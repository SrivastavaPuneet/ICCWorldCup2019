Asghar Afghan	Mohammad Asghar Afghan	December 26, 1987, Kabul, Afghanistan 	33 years 64 days	Afghanistan, Amo Region	Middle-order batsman	Right-hand bat	Right-arm medium-fast	101	Afghanistan v Scotland at Benoni, Apr 19, 2009	"A middle-order batsman, Asghar Stanikzai has a somewhat tuk-tuk-boom approach to batting, his determined presence at the crease occasionally punctuated with flashes of aggressive strokeplay. In Afghanistan's early forays into the top level of the international game his approach was at odds with that of many of his team-mates in the top order, who seemed to play a shot a ball, and Stanikzai's ability to occupy the crease was an important asset to the side. 
 He was with Afghanistan at their first major global tournament, the World T20 in 2010, and also played a vital role in their first win over a Test-playing nation, against Bangladesh in March 2014. In typical style, Stanikzai anchored the innings that day and nudged his way to 37 from 73 balls before he hit a boundary. But he then hit six fours and three sixes, one of which went out of the ground, in the last ten overs and shared in a match-winning 164-run partnership with Samiullah Shenwari. If he can replicate that sort of performance more frequently, Stanikzai has a very handy role to play as Afghanistan's middle-order glue.Liam Brickhill"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221774.html"",""Asghar Afghan"")"	Afghanistan
Ben Stokes	Benjamin Andrew Stokes	June 4, 1991, Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand 	29 years 269 days	England, Canterbury, Durham, Durham 2nd XI, England Development Programme Under-19s, England Lions, England Performance Programme, England Performance Programme XI, England Under-19s, Melbourne Renegades, Rajasthan Royals, Rising Pune Supergiant	Allrounder	Left-hand bat	Right-arm fast-medium	102*	Ireland v England at Dublin, Aug 25, 2011	"The great Irish sports writer Con Houlihan used to say that every team should have a redhead. And it's true that Ben Stokes' combative nature, allied to his powerful frame and outrageous talent, lifted England to another level. Never was that more true than when he secured his place in English cricket history with an indefatigable batting display in the 2019 World Cup final. In making an unbeaten 84 he exhausted every ounce of strength, talent and willpower and then when he imagined it might be all over he came out to bat once more to help win a Super Over by the narrowest of margins. 
 For Stokes, this was a wonderful moment of redemption because it had been his misfortune until then to be remembered for two episodes he would rather forget. The first came in the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup final in Kolkata. Asked to defend 19 in the last over against West Indies, his attempted yorkers missed the mark by inches resulting in Carlos Brathwaite heaving him for four successive sixes into a sweltering night sky.
 The second, and altogether more serious, incident occurred in September 2017. Celebrating an ODI victory in Bristol, Stokes became embroiled in a fight outside a club in the early hours of the morning that resulted in his arrest. A trial at Bristol Crown Court subsequently saw him cleared of the charge of affray but by then the reputational damage had been done. He had already missed the 2017-18 Ashes tour - a toothless England were beaten 4-0 with Stokes not considered for selection - and been stripped of the team's vice-captaincy. 
 It was testament to his immense character that he ensured he would be remembered for more positive reasons. Within months of his comeback, Stokes had played a key role in England's 3-0 Test win in Sri Lanka, their first whitewash series victory in Asia. Trevor Bayliss praised Stokes' attitude as ""exemplary"", saying he had ""learned his lesson"". The World Cup final underlined his immense character. Capable of turning games with his batting, his bowling and in the field, he had attracted comparisons with Ian Botham. Expectations were huge from the outset. He had satisfied them.
 Stokes, from the moment he made his Durham debut, felt very much a product of the northeast of England. He was actually born in Christchurch, New Zealand and came from a rich sporting pedigree with his father, Ged, playing international Rugby League for that country.
 His prodigious talent was clear from an early age. A true allrounder, Stokes debuted for Durham at 17 and dismissed Mark Ramprakash with his third legal delivery in senior cricket. He enjoyed a productive time at the 2009 Under-19 World Cup, scoring a century against India, before registering a maiden fifty on his first-class debut for Durham. But it was in 2011 that he really began to blossom. In April he took 6 for 68 and scored a brilliant hundred that included five sixes in an over, and a month later registered his maiden limited-overs ton. A broken finger hindered his bowling, but he played for England Lions and made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin, going on to play four times against India, albeit with limited impact.
 A first brush with the management was to follow, after being called up to the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia in early 2013. Stokes ended up being sent home with three matches remaining, along with Kent's Matt Coles, after two breaches of discipline. It was a watershed moment, and he was rapidly rehabilitated back at Durham, playing a key role in their Championship-winning season and being recalled to England's limited-overs teams. He took a maiden ODI five-for and won selection for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, a return to Australia that would command attention for the right reasons.
 Stokes' performances were a rare bright spot on a disastrous trip. When the agony was all over, only Stokes returned to England as a star on the rise. Brought into the XI at Adelaide, after Jonathan Trott's untimely departure, his pugnacious nature came to the fore during a maiden Test hundred in Perth, a doughty response out of keeping with England's general demeanour throughout the tour.
 But with fire came combustibility. Stokes missed the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh after reacting to a dismissal in Barbados by punching a dressing room locker and sustaining a broken wrist. During a difficult year, he was dropped from the Test team after making three ducks in a row against India, and then lost his one-day place on the tour of Sri Lanka - ultimately missing out on selection for the 2015 World Cup.
 Stokes, like England after a dismal tournament, needed rejuvenating. It began with the Lord's Test against New Zealand, when Stokes scored 92 and 101 after being promoted to bat at No. 6. A successful Ashes followed and he was also a central figure in the new-look ODI side that began to put the World Cup behind them under the guidance of Bayliss and Paul Farbrace. A few months later he produced a barnstorming 258 from 198 balls against South Africa in Cape Town - the fastest England double-hundred in history and the second fastest of all time - during a stand of 399 with Jonny Bairstow.
 Following his Kolkata nightmare, he nevertheless grew in stature within the side and was promoted to the vice-captaincy (at least until the Bristol episode). He scored his maiden ODI hundred in Dhaka in late 2016 and added four more across international formats the following year, while also taking Test-best figures of 6 for 22 against West Indies at Lord's, becoming a key cog for England despite a chequered injury record.
 An IPL millionaire twice over - he was bought for £1.7m by Rising Pune Supergiant in 2017, winning tournament MVP, and then picked up for £1.4m the following season by Rajasthan Royals - Stokes was one of the most talked-about players in the world. But there was a sense the best was yet to come. Going into 2019, a year containing an Ashes series and a World Cup, he looked to be a player at the peak of his powers who had finally understood the level of sacrifice and discipline required to coax the best out of his undoubted talent.

Lockie Ferguson	Lachlan Hammond Ferguson	June 13, 1991, Auckland 	29 years 260 days	New Zealand, Auckland, Auckland Under-19s, Kolkata Knight Riders, Rising Pune Supergiant	Bowler	Right-hand bat	Right-arm fast	19	Australia v New Zealand at Sydney, Mar 13, 2020	"A right-arm quick with a good bouncer, it is Lockie Ferguson's speed that made a breakout star at the 2019 World Cup in England. Regularly hitting 150kph, Ferguson's raw speed bowling first change yielded 21 wickets at just 19.47 and an economy rate of 4.88. He finished second on the tournament wicket tally behind Mitchell Starc. He was rewarded with being named in the ICC's team of the tournament alongside skipper Kane Williamson.  
 A sporadic presence in the Auckland side in his first two first-class seasons, Ferguson had a breakthrough season in 2014-15, in which his 21 wickets came at an average of 23.38. He took 31 wickets the following year, when he also entered the List A side, enjoying further success there. It was for limited-overs cricket that he first entered the New Zealand squad: he was picked in the ODI side to Australia in December 2016, after an injury to Adam Milne had left the team short of an out-and-out fast bowler. Making his debut in Sydney, Ferguson took the wicket of David Warner in his first over.
 He has become a major weapon in ODI and T20 cricket. He played in the IPL for the Kolkata Knight Riders and Rising Pune Supergiant. He has played first-class cricket for New Zealand A and did an extended stint in England with Derbyshire in 2018. A Test debut came against Australia in Perth in late 2019, but was seemingly a source of great frustration for Ferguson: he didn't last the match, sidelined by a calf strain in the second session of day one.ESPNCricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222627.html"",""Lockie Ferguson"")"	New Zealand

 In essence, he is a batting allrounder, though he started his career as an off-break bowler. Partly the problem is that he is capable, as a batsman, of fulfilling many roles with some competence. He has had success as an opener in Tests and ODIs; he has been game-changing as a limited-overs one down and dangerous as a lower-order slogger; often he has been a stodgy middle-order bulwark. In Twenty20s, he can be brutal anywhere.
 It is thus difficult to recall a definitive Malik high; was it his maiden Test hundred as an opener against Sri Lanka in Colombo? A few hands that led to an ODI series win against India in 2005-06? A Champions Trophy hundred against India?
 His basic game is tight, especially in the subcontinent. He isn't pretty, though there can be pleasantness in his high, stiff-elbowed drives and lofts. Square on both sides he is precise. Further, he runs well. With his flattish, very modern off-spin always useful for more than a few overs and a wicket here and there - less so after concerns over his action - and an athletic and languid presence in the field, Malik should be far greater a sum of his parts than he actually is.
 He was for long earmarked as a potential captain - the late Bob Woolmer thought him the sharpest tack in Pakistan's set-up - but a stint with the captaincy was troubled, unimaginative and ended badly. It got even worse when the board banned him for a year in March 2010 as part of its unprecedented action on senior players after a disastrous tour of Australia.

Although he has struggled to gain much traction at first-class level for South Australia, Richardson is very effective in the shorter forms and in 2019 was a late addition to the World Cup squad. 
 He has been with three IPL franchises, starting with a USD700,000 deal from the Pune Warriors in 2013 although he only played three matches for them. Since then he has appeared for Rajasthan Royals and Bangalore Royal Challengers. 
 His ODI debut came at his home ground, Adelaide Oval, in 2013, but he suffered the ignominy of being ordered out of the attack by the umpires for repeatedly running on the pitch. His breakthrough international performance came in January 2016, when he picked up five wickets in a Man of the Match effort against India in Canberra. He played Australia's next ODI in New Zealand but did not play another for 18 months before returning on the 2017 ODI tour of India. 
 He lost his spot after a tough tour of England in 2018 but a strong BBL for the champions the Melbourne Renegades put him back in the mix.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1186414.html"",""Kane Richardson"")"	Australia
Tom Latham	Thomas William Maxwell Latham	April 2, 1992, Christchurch, Canterbury 	28 years 332 days	New Zealand, Scotland, Canterbury, Canterbury Second XI, Canterbury Under-19s, Durham 2nd XI, New Zealand A, New Zealand Under-19s	Wicketkeeper batsman	Left-hand bat	Right-arm medium	137	New Zealand v Zimbabwe at Dunedin, Feb 3, 2012	"The son of former allrounder Rod Latham, Tom Latham played varied roles for New Zealand since his international debut at the age of 19. He batted in every position from No. 1 to 9 in limited-overs cricket, and also took on the responsibility of being a wicketkeeper. In Tests, however, Latham was primarily used as an opening batsman, and he quickly settled into a position New Zealand had trouble filling for years. 
 Latham had been part of New Zealand's Under-19 World Cup squad in 2010 and later that year he played first-class cricket for Canterbury. In 2012, he made his debut in ODIs and Twenty20 internationals and was shuffled up and down the order for a while but did not cement his spot. 
 Following an impressive domestic season, Latham played his first Test, against India in Wellington, in February 2014 and was picked as an opener for the tour of West Indies a few months later. In the Caribbean, he reeled off three successive half-centuries, contributing to an overseas series win. Against Pakistan in the UAE that November, Latham scored centuries in successive Tests, the first New Zealand batsman to do so for 24 years. He has been a fixture at the top of New Zealand's order in Test cricket ever since. In December 2018, he carried his bat in a Test innings against Sri Lanka in Wellington, making 264 not out to set a new Test match record for the highest score by any opener while carrying his bat, surpassing Alastair Cook's 244 not out in 2017 against Australia. He was also only the second New Zealand opener to carry his bat in a Test. Glenn Turner had previously done it twice. 
 In ODI cricket, he was included in New Zealand's 2015 World Cup squad, but did not get a game as Brendon McCullum's team finished runners-up. However, New Zealand rested several first-choice players from the tour to Africa later that year, and Latham cashed in: he made his maiden ODI hundred in Zimbabwe, and scored three successive half-centuries in South Africa - all while opening the batting. He had had only one 50-plus score in his first 26 ODI innings. 
 After a lean run in 2017 at the top of the order, he was shifted to No.5 and given the gloves following the retirement of Luke Ronchi. He made 103 not out in his first innings at No.5 in a winning chase against India in Mumbai and remained in that spot all the way through to the 2019 World Cup.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222375.html"",""Tom Latham"")"	New Zealand

Liam Plunkett	Liam Edward Plunkett	April 6, 1985, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire 	35 years 328 days	England, Chattogram Challengers, Delhi Daredevils, Dolphins, Durham, Durham 2nd XI, Durham Cricket Board, England Lions, England Under-19s, Kandy Tuskers, Karachi Kings, Melbourne Stars, Surrey, Sylhet Sixers, Yorkshire	Bowler	Right-hand bat	Right-arm fast	56	Pakistan v England at Lahore, Dec 10, 2005	"Liam Plunkett didn't gain too many headlines after England's World Cup victory - Ben Stokes made sure of that - but, by the time the tournament ended, he could rest assured he had played a full part in the triumph.  
 By claiming three wickets in the final - including the key one of Kane Willamson - Plunkett had replicated the role he had fulfilled all tournament: offering his captain control and the promise of wickets in the middle-overs. 
 It had felt, in the months ahead of the announcement of the final squad for the World Cup, that 34-year-old Plunkett was clinging on to his place. His pace, once as sharp as anyone in the land, had dropped and his spot in the side was under threat from the likes of David Willey, Chris Jordan and the Curran brothers.
 Ultimately, however, his increasing skill - his cutters, delivered from height, proved desperately hard for batsmen to negotiate on surfaces that proved surprisingly receptive for him  - won him a place in the squad and it was no coincidence that England won all seven of the World Cup matches he played. Both his economy-rate - he conceded 4.85 runs per over - and average - his 11 wickets came at a cost of 24.11 apiece - were among the best in the competition. Still, it was not a complete surprise when, just a couple of months later, his name was omitted from the list of central contracts for the following year. ""Disappointment is an understatement,"" he tweeted in response.
 Plunkett had feared his career was over long before all that. A move south, from Durham to Yorkshire, after the 2012 season, revived him. Rather than slipping out of the game, he rediscovered his pace and ambition in one of English cricket's story-book recoveries. England, pummelled by the Australian Mitchell Johnson, and eager to find an out-and-out quick bowler of their own, liked what they saw during a Lions recall, and he played the four Tests of the 2014 summer as a shock trooper - two each against Sri Lanka and India - before succumbing to injury. 
 Plunkett's return was not entirely untroubled; at times his control deserted him and his around-the-wicket approach did not always drum up the anticipated menace. But he stayed true to the exhortations of Yorkshire's coach, Jason Gillespie, to keep it simple and just bowl fast and he took 18 wickets in four Tests, with his match figures of nine for 176 against Sri Lanka on his adopted home ground of Headingley the highlight, a feat overshadowed by Sri Lanka's last-over win. Sternly bearded, with an upright style and strikingly gym-honed upper body, he regularly exceeded speeds of 90mph, but England seemed to conclude that subtlety and control was missing and thereafter chose to utilise him exclusively in white-ball cricket.
 Plunkett's initial selection for England's tour of Pakistan and India in 2005-06 represented the culmination of a two-year rise to prominence.  A bustling fast-medium seamer blessed with an ability to bowl an occasional unplayable ball and a powerful striker down the order, he briefly promised to have a lengthy international career only for issues with his control - and, in his final season at Durham in 2012, a loss of confidence in his action - to lower his sights.
 Having made his first-class debut for Durham in 2003, Plunkett took on immediate responsibilities in the absence of Steve Harmison and the injured Mark Davies, and in 2005 took 50 wickets in a season for the first time. He made his Test debut in a thumping England defeat against Pakistan in Lahore, following the withdrawal of Simon Jones with an ankle injury, and announced himself as a capable allrounder with a composed half-century in only his second ODI against the same opposition. 
 He was selected for England's Ashes campaign in Australia in 2006-7 and for seven gruelling weeks he was the forgotten man of a dismal Test tour. But as England, against all predictions, regrouped to win the one-day series, he seized his opportunity to impress with 12 wickets in the one-day series, including 3 for 43 in the decisive second final against Australia. It was a performance that secured his World Cup passage, though he only played three games and lacked the incisiveness he had shown in Australia.
 A lack of England engagements freed Plunkett up for his Durham duties, and in 2007 he played a role in their first domestic trophy triumph, in their sixteenth year of first-class status, taking three wickets as Durham won the rain-interrupted Friends Provident final by 125 runs at Lord's. A regular in England Lions squads, Plunkett spent a winter as the Dolphins' overseas player in South Africa in 2007-08 and shared in Durham's Championship success the following summer. Durham retained the title in 2009 and Plunkett was at the forefront of their success with 49 wickets in the season, including match figures of 9 for 149 in the innings win over Nottinghamshire that sealed the title.
 Plunkett looked set for a second crack at international cricket when he was named in England's squad for their Test series against South Africa in 2009-10, but he was overtaken by the likes of Graham Onions, his Durham team mate, Stuart Broad and Ajmal Shahzad in the fast-bowling ranks and has had to be content with sporadic appearances since. 
 Subsequently, a combination of injuries and problems with his action saw Plunkett slip down the pecking order at Durham and after two lean seasons, amounting to three Championship appearances, he was told he could look for a new county. Yorkshire took the opportunity to offer him a three-year contract, enabling him to team up again with his former Durham coach, Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket at Headingley, who like Gillespie proved a positive influence. He immediately showed signs of a resurgence, taking 36 wickets in 12 Championship matches. Yorkshire capped him. As he was born in Middlesbrough - part of the old county boundaries  - they felt they had been entitled to him all along.  With the club looking to rebuild, however, he moved to Surrey on a three-year deal at the end of the 2018 season.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1223535.html"",""Liam Plunkett"")"	England

De Silva had been picked on potential in Sri Lanka's mid-year T20s against Pakistan, in 2015, but didn't quite convince he was a T20 batsman, hitting 45 off 47 balls across two innings.

 De Silva first topped the batting charts in the Super T20 Provincial Tournament in early 2016, hitting 234 runs at a strike rate of 133, in six innings.

He won a pace contest in 2007, impressing the talent scouts in a soft-ball event, and was sent straight to Sri Lanka Cricket's academy. He follows in the Sri Lankan tradition of maverick bowlers with unconventional actions. Like Lasith Malinga, he has a slinging action and has troubled many batsmen in domestic cricket with his pace, generated from a long run-up.

Ngidi was schooled at Kwa-Zulu Natal's Hilton College and was involved at every provincial age-group level from Under-13 upwards.  
 He played for Kwa-Zulu Natal Under-19s at the Khaya Majola week in 2014, where he was spotted by Northerns. They facilitated his move up country, where he honed his skills at the University of Pretoria. Ngidi was identified as a T20 prospect early on when he finished as the joint second-highest wicket-taker in the Africa Cup, a provincial T20 tournament that serves as a curtain raiser to the season, in September 2015. His six wickets came at an average of 12.50 and helped Northerns win the title. He was named Africa T20 Cup player of the year and was also promoted to the franchise team, Titans, for parts of their T20 campaign. Ngidi played in the final for Titans in 2015-16, which they won, and was a central figure in their title defence the following season. 
 In January 2017, Ngidi was picked for South Africa's T20 squad to face Sri Lanka and was named Man of the Match on debut. Having largely been touted as a limited-overs prospect till then, a surprise was in store a year later: a maiden Test cap arrived against India in Centurion, and, yet again, what a debut it was. Ngidi's second-innings six-for helped South Africa knock India over for 151 and wrap up the series. Once again, he was named Man of the Match on debut.Firdose Moonda"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1185194.html"",""Lungi Ngidi"")"	South Africa

As a youth cricketer, Jeewan won several prestigious awards, including the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2001, the Man-of-the-Tournament awards in the Under-17 Asia Cup in Pakistan and the 2001 U-19 World Cup in New Zealand, where he bowled a record-breaking spell of 7 for 19 against Zimbabwe. However, during his six years for SSC, he hardly got anopportunity to bowl his legspinners, but his move to Tamil Union in 2008-09 opened the doors for him to display his all-round talent.  
 In the recently concluded domestic season, Mendis won the Man-of-the-Tournament and Man-of-the-Final awards, scoring 450 runs and taking 26 wickets to help TamilUnion emerge the Premier limited-overs champions. In the Premier League, heaccumulated 600 runs and captured 36 wickets to win the Player-of-the-Tournament prize once again - a unique double underlying the fact that he is a cricketer suitable for all versions of the game. Mainly a top-order batsman at No. 3 or 4 from his school days, Mendis honed his spin-bowling skills under the national spin bowling coach, Piyal Wijetunge. Mendis says batsmen find it difficult to read his leg spin or googly because of the way he grips the ball. An outstanding fielder, Mendis believes he is at his peak and selection to the Sri Lanka A team for the upcoming tri-nation series against Canada and Holland is one step towards achieving his life-long ambition of representing his country.

A hard-hitting allrounder, Brathwaite made his international debut in the limited-overs formats in 2011 but it was his contributions to West Indies' Test series in Australia in 2015-16 that helped gain him an IPL contract. He then proved the wisdom of Delhi Daredevils' decision to sign him above more high-profile names by taking 3 for 23 and clubbing 34 from 10 balls to give West Indies their second World T20 title. 
 Brathwaite provided a glimpse of his talent when he announced himself with a haul of 7 for 90 on his first-class debut against Trinidad & Tobago, and backed it up with a consistent season that yielded 26 sticks in eight games. His performances won early recognition when he was picked for the Bangladesh tour later in 2011, making his his ODI and T20I debuts, but he had to wait more than three years for his next chance. He made a comeback to the limited-overs formats on the tour of South Africa in January 2015, before making his Test debut on the tour of Australia in December 2015.
 Despite West Indies' overall struggles, he impressed in his first two Tests. At the Boxing Day game in Melbourne, he helped Darren Bravo stem a first-innings collapse with a 59 on debut at No. 8. In the rain-affected Sydney Test, he struck a lively 71-ball 69. During the IPL 2016 player auction, he attracted a surprise bid of Rs 4.2 crore (US$620,000) from Delhi Daredevils, 14 times his base price of Rs 30 lakh. A couple of months later, with West Indies needing 19 from six balls, he completed victory over England in the most emphatic manner possible to confirm his dramatic rise.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1239257.html"",""Carlos Brathwaite"")"	West Indies

Though he would earn a Test cap in February 2016, it was in one-day domestic cricket that Nicholls had largely made his mark, hitting 454 runs in the 2014-15 Ford Trophy at an average of 75.66, with strike-rate of 105.82. Consequently promoted to the New Zealand A team, he further outlined his value in a home series against Sri Lanka A, hitting two hundreds and a fifty in his three innings in the unofficial Tests, before averaging 84.50 in the one-dayers.  
 His impact at the top level wasn't quite immediate - it wasn't until his fifth ODI innings that Nicholls crossed fifty, and though he scored a half-century on Test debut against Australia, didn't quite do enough to secure his place in the XI. However, coach Mike Hesson spoke of Nicholls as a player worth investing in, and the returns did eventually begin to come. He hit a maiden Test hundred against South Africa at the Basin Reserve, in March 2017.
 Over the next two years he made himself the bedrock of New Zealand's Test middle order and played some pivotal innings. He made an unbeaten 145 against England in Auckland that helped set up a famous series win. His next Test century was part of a 212-run stand with skipper Kane Williamson in Abu Dhabi to help New Zealand to a drought-breaking away series win over Pakistan.
 He was in and out of the ODI team over that time, unable to nail down a spot in the order, but an opportunity presented to open midway through the 2019 World Cup. He saved his best innings for the final against England were he made a crucial 55 in tough batting conditions at Lord's that so nearly helped New Zealand to victory.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222374.html"",""Henry Nicholls"")"	New Zealand

At just 16, Mujeeb wants to follow in the footsteps of Rashid Khan, his senior by two years. There's plenty of hype surrounding him too, supported by the weight of his performances. 
 Mujeeb was part of an Afghanistan Under-19 side that clinically dismantled Bangladesh 3-1 in their own den. Bowling predominantly with the new ball, Mujeeb, who picked up eight wickets in the first three games of that series, nearly doubled his tally during the course of a nine-over spell in which he took 7 for 19, the joint second-best best bowling figures in all Youth ODIs. This performance was all the more spectacular as it helped Afghanistan defend 133. Mujeeb went on to pick up 17 wickets in the series, the most by a bowler in a bilateral Youth ODI series. 
 These performances against their own country perhaps coaxed Comilla Victorians to sign him as a replacement player during the 2017-18 edition of the Bangladesh Premier League. 
 Mujeeb continued to enhance his reputation on the global stage by starring in Afghanistan's historic triumph at the Under-19 Asia Cup, where they beat Pakistan in the final with him claiming a five-wicket haul. The title-clinching performance was preceded by a six-for in the semi-final against Nepal. He finished the tournament with 20 wickets in five games. 
 At the Under-19 World Cup, his four-wicket haul helped Afghanistan beat New Zealand to secure a semi-final berth. Two days later, he was picked up by Kings XI Punjab for an astonishing INR 4 crore (630,000 USD approx.) for IPL 2018."

Before he had turned 21, Rabada had already established himself as a potential leader of the attack. 
 Rabada thrust himself into the international spotlight at the 2014 Under-19 World Cup, where he took 6 for 25 against Australia in the semi-final. South Africa went on to win the title - their first - and Rabada finished as their highest wicket-taker.  
 Three months later, he was awarded a franchise contract with Lions and before the year was up, he had been included in the national ODI and Test squads. He made his T20I debut against Australia in Adelaide in November 2014.  
 In early 2015, Rabada showed his ability in the longer format. He claimed the South African record for the best bowling figures in a first-class match, 14 for 105, surpassing the haul taken by Dale Steyn seven seasons before. He finished the season as the third-highest wicket-taker in the Sunfoil Series. 
 He was included in all three squads to tour Bangladesh in July-August 2015, and became only the second player to take a hat-trick on ODI debut, eventually finishing with the best figures by a first-timer: 6 for 16. 
 Rabada also played in a home series against New Zealand and was then included on a tour to India. There, he led the ODI wicket-takers' list with Steyn after both claimed 10 wickets. Injuries to Morne Morkel, then Steyn and Vernon Philander, meant Rabada got a chance to play in three of the four Tests of that series. On inhospitable pitches, he worked hard, often without reward but displayed the stamina required of a Test bowler. 
 Rabada has had more assistance from the surfaces at home, where he played against England in the absence of Steyn and Philander. In the final Test, with South Africa having already lost the series, Rabada became the youngest South African to take 10 wickets in a match when he finished with 13 for 144. 
 His workload did not lessen as he played a further four ODIs and two T20Is against England, three T20Is against Australia, and also led the attack at the 2016 World T20 in India. After his performances, Rabada seemed primed for an IPL stint but chose to sign a county deal with Kent for a month instead.

He first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2015, but displayed greater consistency in the Syed Mushtaq Ali domestic T20 tournament in January 2016. He finished as the leading run-getter, for Baroda, with 377 runs in 10 innings at an average of 53.85.  
 Pandya also took 10 wickets and was instrumental in Baroda making the final. He was subsequently called up for India's limited-overs tour to Australia, where he made his international debut, before impressing with the ball on the seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh at the Asia Cup. Pandya appeared to be the answer to India's search for a seam-bowling allrounder, and with his sprightly fielding complementing his main skill-sets, he sealed his spot in India's 2016 World T20 squad.  While Pandya batted only twice in the tournament, he had a lot more to do with the ball. He bowled the last over against Bangladesh and defended two runs off three balls to help India to a one-run win. A little more than a week after his heroics, Pandya endured the disappointment of bowling a no ball to reprieve Lendl Simmons, whose unbeaten innings helped West Indies clinch the semi-final.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1223366.html"",""Hardik Pandya"")"	India

He has followed the same tried and tested route to the national side as many of his generation that came after the initial Afghan cricketing pioneers, with age-group cricket preparing him for the big stage. His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match. He started 2015 well with a maiden ODI fifty, a boundary-laden 83 against Ireland, and cruised into Afghanistan's World Cup squad.Liam Brickhill	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221792.html"",""Najibullah Zadran"")"	Afghanistan

 As a player, Hafeez gives the team plenty of options: he usually bats aggressively at the top of the order, but his organised technique also means he can switch to defensive mode if required. He doesn't flight his offbreaks much, but his excellent control over line and length allows the captain to use him at almost any stage of an innings. He is also one of the better fielders in the Pakistan team, especially in the point region.
 Despite these skills, Hafeez failed to create a regular place for himself in the Pakistan in his first seven years in international cricket, primarily due to his inability to convert his starts into substantial scores. He scored plenty of pretty 30s and 40s, laced with some exquisite cover-drives, but that only helped cement the opinion that Hafeez may forever remain a player whose potential exceeds performance.
 To a large extent, that changed in 2011, as Hafeez put in consistent displays with both bat and ball in all forms of the game. It actually started in the series against South Africa in November 2010, and then continued through 2011, a year which fetched him two centuries in Tests and three in ODIs, apart from two fifties in Twenty20 internationals. He won an incredible ten Man-of-the-Match awards in international cricket that year, and became only the third cricketer - after Sanath Jayasuriya and Jacques Kallis - to score 1000-plus runs and take 30 or more wickets in ODIs in a calendar year. With Taufeeq Umar, he formed Pakistan's most stable opening combination in Tests, as his aggression at the top of the order became a perfect counterfoil to Taufeeq's defensive approach. 
 Since then, Hafeez has continued to frustrate and amaze, and the frequency with which he can switch from one mode to the other is a large part of his enigma. By many metrics, he's one of Pakistan's most prolific cricketers, but arguably also one of the more profligate ones in the way he's handled his immense talent. 
 The elegance of the full face of his bat, particularly when driving through the off side, means any runs he scores are more memorable than they otherwise might be - and there have been plenty of them; he's number 10 on the all time ODI runs list for Pakistan. There was a century against India in Dhaka that preceded a disappointing barren spell, and then a purple patch against Sri Lanka where he smashed three hundreds in four games in 2013. A swashbuckling unbeaten 57 against India in the Champions Trophy final may ultimately be his most famous innings, as it powered Pakistan to a total they wouldn't let India get close to. 
 It is his usefulness with the ball, though, that has kept him lingering around the Pakistan setup for so long. His consistency gives his side another option, which explains the reluctance to drop him even when his stock skill - batting - is letting him down. He has opened the bowling for Pakistan on several occasions - particularly in T20 cricket - and briefly took on the mantle of lead spinner after Saeed Ajmal was banned for an illegal action. 
 That curse, however, has plagued Hafeez throughout his career too, and he has found himself suspended for an illegal bowling action no less than three times. Tellingly, it is in those periods that his place in the side has been in the greatest peril, as his technical flaws as a batsman appear destined to go largely unremedied. He was ignored for a recent series in Zimbabwe, but for a player with 50 Tests, 200 ODIs, a shade under 100 T20Is, and countless comebacks, one would have to be particularly brave to be writing his eulogy just yet.

A former chess player who represented India at junior levels, Chahal made his first-class debut for Haryana the same year and was signed by Mumbai Indians in 2011 to be part of their IPL squad.  
 He didn't play a game that season but was still named in Mumbai's Champions League T20 squad the same year. It was in the Champions League that he got an extended run in the side - he featured in the playing XI in all the matches and starred in Mumbai's win in the final with a spell of 3-0-9-2. However, in the next two years with Mumbai, he managed only one game. His IPL fortunes mirrored those in domestic cricket, where he played in only eight matches in three seasons from 2011-12 onwards and picked up just 16 wickets.
 It was with Royal Challengers Bangalore, though, that he found the bulk of his success. He was their highest wicket-taker for two years running since the 2015 season and by virtue of that earned his first India caps in ODIs and T20Is on a tour of Zimbabwe in June 2016. While that series may have been seen as an opportunity to blood new players into international cricket, Chahal was called up again into the Indian T20 line-up to face England in January 2017, and delivered in style in the deciding game: his 6 for 25 in that match in Bangalore was part of an England collaspse of 8 for 8, and the third-best figures till then in T20Is.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1239214.html"",""Yuzvendra Chahal"")"	India

Known chiefly for the turn he generates and the flight he fearlessly trusts, Sodhi's journey to top-level cricket has been a triumph of determination over significant odds. 
 Born in Ludhiana, in the Indian state of Punjab, Sodhi began his cricket in south Auckland, where his parents had migrated in his youth. Papatoetoe High School is not renowned for its cricket, and perhaps as a result, Sodhi had trouble establishing himself in regional representative teams, and may have also been a victim of Auckland's pitches that provide little aid to spin bowlers, and captains who are not versed in how to use them.  
 Undeterred, Sodhi left school early and a training stint with Dipak Patel and Matt Horne was when his career finally got some traction. A move to Northern Districts allayed the frustration of not being able to displace the spinner in the Auckland side, and after an encouraging 2012-13 season, Sodhi earned a trip to the subcontinent with New Zealand A, which cleared the path to the New Zealand side.Andrew Fidel Fernando"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222376.html"",""Ish Sodhi"")"	New Zealand

The previous year, he had taken up a job on the Adelaide Oval groundstaff, and his bowling talent was spotted by the Redbacks' Big Bash coach Darren Berry. Lyon impressed in T20s for South Australia, made his first-class debut, and within seven months was a Test cricketer. A classical offspinner who flights the ball and looks for wickets, Lyon struck with his first delivery in Test cricket when he had Kumar Sangakkara caught at slip in Galle. It was part of a haul of 5 for 34 and the beginning of a career that would, for the most part, end Australia's cycle of churning through Test spinners in the post-Warne era. By 2015, Lyon had become Australia's most successful Test offspinner of all time, passing Hugh Trumble's tally of 141 wickets, and he was affectionately nicknamed by his teammates as the GOAT - greatest of all time - as a result.  
 However, Lyon's career was not without bumps along the way. In 2013 he was dropped from the Test team twice, first in India after he was attacked by MS Dhoni in the first Test in Chennai, and then for the first two Tests of the Ashes tour of England. The Ashes axing was especially galling for Lyon, given that he had taken nine wickets in his previous Test, the fourth and final Test of the Indian tour in Delhi, and he was overlooked for the uncapped teenager Ashton Agar. By the third Test of the Ashes, Lyon was rightfully back in the side and continued to be a consistent performer. One gap in his game had been the ability to bowl Australia to victory in the fourth innings of a Test, but he finally achieved that against India in Adelaide in 2014-15, in what became his first Man-of-the-Match performance.
 He became just the sixth Australian to take 300 Test wickets, and only the second spinner behind Warne, in Cape Town during 2018, but the milestone was largely missed in the aftermath of the ball-tampering scandal. Despite first making his name for South Australia in T20, Lyon has generally been considered by the national selectors a Test-only prospect - his limited batting often making him a tricky fit in the eleven. However, in 2018-19 he became a regular member of Australia's one-day squad and was included in the 2019 World Cup squad. He is an excellent fielder and his direct hit to run out James Vince at the Gabba in 2017-18 Ashes was a key moment on the opening day of the series.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1186412.html"",""Nathan Lyon"")"	Australia

 He is a batting allrounder who bowls right-arm offspin with a quiet action where he trundles to the wicket before giving a slight leap before rotating his upper body. It is a beautifully simple action that has yielded him many wickets in the U-19 and first-class level.
 Born in Barisal, Mehedi grew up in Daulatpur in the outskirts of Khulna city. He learned offspin from Sheikh Salahuddin, the former Bangladesh player regarded as the best offspinner of his generation. Salahuddin passed away in October 2013. 
 Mehedi spent two years at the U-19 level, captaining Bangladesh to the 2014 World Cup in the UAE. He made his first-class debut in the 2014-15 National Cricket League but it was the next season's tournament when he really made a mark. Mehedi took 30 wickets at 16.43, including three five-fors. He was a star in the 2016 U-19 World Cup, with his spirit coming through as a standout part of his character.Mohammad Isam"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221384.html"",""Mehidy Hasan Miraz"")"	Bangladesh
Peter Handscomb	Peter Stephen Patrick Handscomb	April 26, 1991, Melbourne, Victoria 	29 years 308 days	Australia, Australia A, Australia Under-19s, Durham, Gloucestershire, Hobart Hurricanes, Leicestershire 2nd XI, Melbourne Stars, Rising Pune Supergiants, Victoria, Victoria Under-17s, Victoria Under-23s, Yorkshire	Batsman	Right-hand bat		117	Australia v Pakistan at Perth, Jan 19, 2017	"A middle-order batsman with unique technique, Peter Handscomb earned his first Test call-up in 2016-17 after a prolific period for Victoria. His inclusion for the Adelaide Test against South Africa followed a career-best 215 in the Sheffield Shield, and the previous summer he had been the competition's third-leading run scorer. Handscomb immediately showed his comfort at Test level by striking 54 on debut against South Africa in Adelaide, also hitting the winning runs, and a maiden century came in his next Test against Pakistan at the Gabba. By the end of his first home summer of Test cricket, Handscomb was in the remarkable position of having not been dismissed below 50 in any of his first seven innings of Test cricket - the first player in Test history to have achieved that feat.  
 He debuted in ODI cricket in the same summer and then went on the tours of India and Bangladesh, playing vital match-saving and match-winning hands in Ranchi and Chittagong. But questions about his technique against pace bowling were raised during the 2017-18 Ashes and he lost his place after two Tests. He was recalled in Johannesburg on the infamous tour of South Africa following the Cape Town ball-tampering scandal, and looked set to become a permanent fixture following the suspensions of Steve Smith and David Warner, but a poor Australia A tour of India saw him miss selection for the UAE Test tour against Pakistan in October 2018.
 He was then recalled, dropped, recalled and dropped again during the home Test series against India and Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, he established himself in the ODI team as an adaptable middle order player. He made his T20I debut as a wicketkeeper on the limited-overs tour of India and scored  a maiden ODI century to help Australia to a record chase of 359 in Mohali. He was left out of the 2019 World Cup squad despite playing the previous 13 ODIs, because of Smith's return. He was thrown into the side for the semi-final against England as an injury replacement, but made only 4 as Australia fell to a heavy defeat.
 Handscomb first came to prominence in 2015 when captained Australia A and was part of Australia's ODI squad in England in 2015 without playing a match. The owner of a British passport as the Australian-born son of English parents, Handscomb was a talented junior tennis player but chose a career on the pitch rather than on the court. He captained Victoria to an Australian one-day domestic title in 2018-19. He has also spent time in county cricket, playing with Gloucestershire in 2015 before stints with Yorkshire and Durham. He was appointed Middlesex's captain by Stuart Law ahead of the 2020 season.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/767345.html?alt=1"",""Peter Handscomb"")"	Australia

He struck a century and three fifties, before having to head to the Bangladesh Under-19 training camp ahead of the 2014 World Cup in the UAE. The opportunity to get out of age-group cricket quite early proved to be an important milestone in his development.  
 His first-class debut in the 2013-14 season wasn't memorable: he got a pair against Khulna in Cox's Bazar. But in the following season, he struck 250 and 282, his first two hundred-plus scores in first-class cricket. He added another double-hundred in 2015. A Twenty20 International debut followed in January 2016, but it was a forgettable one against Zimbabwe. By then it was clear that he wouldn't be in coach Chandika Hathurusingha's 2016 World T20 plans.
 Mosaddek however kept making the runs in domestic cricket, and in the 2016 Dhaka Premier League he was winning matches for eventual champions Abahani. At barely 20, Mosaddek was hailed by Abahani captain Tamim Iqbal as one with a ""45-year-old brain"". He remained on the fringes of the national team, and made his Test debut in Colombo in March 2017 in what was Bangladesh's 100th Test.

Jos Buttler	Joseph Charles Buttler	September 8, 1990, Taunton, Somerset 	30 years 173 days	England, Comilla Victorians, England Development Programme Under-19s, England Lions, England Performance Programme, England Performance Programme XI, England Under-19s, Khulna Royal Bengals, Lancashire, Melbourne Renegades, Mumbai Cricket Association XI, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Somerset, Somerset 2nd XI, Sydney Thunder	Wicketkeeper batsman	Right-hand bat		150	England v Pakistan at Dubai (DSC), Feb 21, 2012	"England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler has helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, whilst also reigniting his Test career after a surprise recall by new national selector Ed Smith. 
 Softly-spoken and unassuming, with supple hands and a great eye, Buttler kills opposing attacks with kindness, with a graceful flip shot for six over long-on and the occasional resort to a nerveless ramp shot over the wicketkeeper among his most eye-catching shots in an inventive repertoire. Like his captain, Eoin Morgan, his unflustered response to even the most daunting run chase is one of his greatest assets, his steely resolve hidden beneath a benign exterior. Such was his impact for Mumbai Indians in his first appearance in IPL in 2016, capable of mayhem late in the innings, that for a young cricket follower in India with only Twenty20 in their heart, it was possible to imagine that England had rarely, if ever, produced a player of such star quality. 
 Buttler was in the crowd at Taunton as a young spectator during the 1999 World Cup when India's Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid thrashed what was then the highest partnership in ODI cricket. He was hooked. Somerset gained special permission from the ECB to add him to their Academy at 12, two years early, and he came to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somerset's title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somerset's run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somerset's defeat to Surrey.
 He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of England's T20 side. A first ODI appearance came against Pakistan in the UAE during the winter, though he had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper. When Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Craig Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India. With Kieswetter still preferred as Somerset's gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future.
 England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's as he led a failed run chase virtually single-handed. When Matt Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble - what proved to be a career-ending injury - the selectors gambled by throwing Buttler into the Test team. He scored five half-centuries in his first eight Tests, including 85 on debut against India at the Ageas Bowl, but his form faltered and he lost the gloves to Jonny Bairstow on England's tour of the UAE in 2015-16, during a period where his keeping started to make necessary improvements but his batting slip away.
 There were no such doubts about his place in the white-ball teams. His seniority was recognised when he was named Morgan's vice-captain for the 2015 World Cup and, although that tournament was an unhappy one for England, Buttler was a key member of the side that reached the final of the World T20 a year later. His dynamic batting was emblematic of England's one-day reinvention under Morgan, though he also began to demonstrate increased range to his game - when he led England to an extraordinary one-wicket win over Australia at Old Trafford in 2018, his unbeaten 110 from 122 balls was by far the slowest hundred of his career.
 Amid increasing demand on the T20 circuit, which included spells in the Bangladesh Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, Buttler's Test star seemed to be waning. He was briefly recalled in India in 2016-17 but then spent more than a year on the fringes, and was even overlooked as Bairstow's back-up during the following winter's Ashes tour. However, his stellar form for Rajashtan Royals in the 2018 IPL - he equalled the league record for consecutive fifties - prompted Smith to pick up the phone. Impressive contributions against Pakistan followed, and then, at long last, a maiden Test hundred, recorded in defeat to India at Trent Bridge. Suddenly, Buttler was integral in all three formats once again.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222871.html"",""Jos Buttler"")"	England

He was born in Sydney and raised in Canberra but has made his career with Western Australia after there during the 2009 off-season. He made his first-class debut in 2011-12 but his breakthrough season was 2013-14, when he finished second only to Steve O'Keefe on the Sheffield Shield wicket tally with 40 victims at 22.70. That season earned him a call-up to the Australia A squad for their four-day matches against South Africa in the 2014 winter.  
 He followed up with another superb 2014-15 season where he helped WA win a domestic one-day title and Perth Scorchers win the BBL title. He was named the Australian domestic cricketer of the year in January 2015. Injuries plagued him in 2016-17 but he took 14 for 89 in a Shield match against Victoria, the ninth best Shield figures in history and the second best since World War Two. He has only played a handful of first-class matches since as ongoing back issues have forced him to focus on limited-overs cricket. 
 He made his T20 international debut in India in October 2017 and took an impressive 4 for 21 in his second game in Guwahati, removing India's top four of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Manish Pandey. He made his ODI debut in January 2019 and removed Dhawan again in his first over. He was used judiciously in a specialist new ball role on the ODI tours of India and the UAE leading to his selection in the 2019 World Cup squad.

Although he was part of the Under-12 provincial side, his scholarship to Glenwood High School, the alma mater of Steven Jack, came through hockey. Phehlukwayo's classmates were surprised when they discovered his cricketing ability, which has mostly come to the fore with ball in hand. 
 Phehlukwayo was part of the South Africa Under-19 team for the World Cup in 2014, but only featured in one match. He was also part of the Dolphins squad that played in the 2014 Champions League T20. Still 18, he appeared out of his depth in the four matches he played, but the experience boded well for his future at the franchise.
 In the 2015-16 season, Phehlukwayo was the Dolphins' leading wicket-taker in the 20-over competition, in which they reached the final. He took 12 wickets in as many matches at 21.75 and earned a place in the South African XI that played against the touring England side in Kimberley.
 He was then included in the South Africa A side that toured Zimbabwe and Australia that winter, and excelled in both the first-class and the limited-overs fixtures. His career-best 5 for 62 bowled South Africa A to victory over Zimbabwe A in an unofficial Test, and he was the team's leading wicker-taker in the quadrangular 50-over competition in Australia, in which South Africa A finished third.
 In September 2016, at the age of 20, Phehlukwayo was named in South Africa's ODI squad for home series against Ireland and Australia. He impressed on his maiden outing and was the top wicket-taker for South Africa in their 5-nil ODI sweep against Australia. A groin injury suffered in the domestic T20 competition later that year sidelined Phehlukwayo temporarily but he returned to play in series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand and in the Champions Trophy. His ability to hold his nerve at the death became particularly notable, especially in T20 cricket. 
 In June 2016, with just 24 first-class games to his name, Phehlukwayo was included in South Africa's Test squad for the four-match series in England. Firdose Moonda"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1100159.html?alt=1"",""Andile Phehlukwayo"")"	South Africa

The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations. 
 There haven't been too many bowlers of his ilk in India, and Kuldeep, therefore, attracted immediate attention after successful stints at the Under-19 level.
 Kuldeep played his first India U-19 game in April 2012 as a 17-year old and and despite consistently taking wickets, he stayed below the radar.  It was the 2014 edition of the U-19 World Cup in Dubai that pushed his stocks higher. After a wicketless spell in the opening game against Pakistan, Kuldeep picked up a hat-trick in the next game against Scotland. ""As Kuldeep, mere ko wicket nikaalna hai (As Kuldeep, I knew I had to take wickets),"" he said after the match.
 He gained in stature in the games that followed, repeatedly troubling batsmen with his turn and finished with 14 wickets, the joint second-highest in the tournament. The performance seemed to justify why Kolkata Knight Riders' scouts had forked out $66,000 for him in the IPL auction prior to the Under-19 World Cup.
 Kuldeep had been part of the Mumbai Indians set-up in the 2012 season where he had a fond memory of bamboozling Sachin Tendulkar once in the nets with his wrong'un. That did not translate into an IPL debut. Nor did it happen with Knight Riders in the 2014 season. He had to wait until the Champions League where, playing as a support bowler to Sunil Narine, he impressed with his economy. Following those performances, he was included in India's ODI squad for the series against West Indies in October 2014, and he made his first-class and List A debuts shortly after.
 Having established himself in the Uttar Pradesh and India A sides, Kuldeep made his Test debut against Australia in a deciding match in Dharamsala in March 2017 and claimed 4 for 68 in the first innings.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1223373.html"",""Kuldeep Yadav"")"	India

An efficient allrounder - a strong middle-order batsman who can bowl flighted offspin - Nabi's rise, like Afghanistan's, has been staggering. He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage. 
 Nabi took up cricket at the age of 10 while living in Peshawar. Honing his skills with endless sessions of tennis-ball cricket, he managed to begin training at Arshad Khan's academy in Peshawar and made his competitive debut against Rahim Yar Khan Cricket Association in Pakistan's erstwhile Cornelius Trophy in 2003, making 61 after having just met most of his team-mates. On a tour of India he caught Mike Gatting's eye with a century against a visiting MCC side. That brought him more valuable experience with MCC, for whom he made his first-class debut, and he went on to play a major role in Afghanistan's progress to the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in 2009. Nabi struck 58 against Scotland on one-day international debut and 102 in his first first-class game for Afghanistan, against a Zimbabwe XI.
 Nabi has remained the backbone of the side that qualified for the World Twenty20 in 2010, 2012 and 2014 and, recently, the 2015 World Cup. Nabi has had a couple of stints as Afghanistan's captain, taking over the role from Nawroz Mangal in March 2013 and leading the side to the 2015 World Cup. He has overseen rapid changes in Afghanistan's cricket but has remained calmer than most. Nabi has also played club and domestic cricket in England, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where he has enjoyed varying success but has gained in experience.Liam Brickhill"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221789.html"",""Mohammad Nabi"")"	Afghanistan

Holder was only 23 at the time, and was still making his way as a fast bowler and a lower-middle order batsman. Less than a year later, he took over the Test team too, indicating how much the WICB and men in the know - ranging from Viv Richards to Brian Lara to Tony Cozier - believed in this man, who comes across as remarkably level-headed and mature for someone so young.  
 A reliable batsman and a steady medium-pacer - both suits being works in progress - Holder was born in Barbados and was the recipient of the prestigious Lord Gavron Award in 2009. He played one first-class game before being called up for the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand, where he was his team's leading wicket-taker with 13 wickets. He replaced the injured Tino Best for West Indies' limited-overs leg of the Bangladesh tour in 2011, and made his international debut in Australia a few months later. A Test debut came against New Zealand in Bridgetown in June 2014, and he took two wickets and made a fighting 52 at No. 7. He had been signed by Chennai Super Kings in the 2013 IPL auction, but was dropped. However, in 2016, he was picked up by Kolkata Knight Riders.
 At 6 feet and seven inches tall, Holder is a soft-spoken man, and so there were questions over his ability to lead a team of older and vastly more experienced cricketers. His maiden Test century - against England in April 2015 - showcased his mental strength. West Indies were 189 for 6 when he came in to bat at No. 8 and his 214-minute defiance saved the match for his team. On a tour of Australia in 2015-16, his authority seemed to come into question when stories of his bowlers refusing to bowl into the wind surfaced, but Holder quashed them on Twitter saying, ""Be careful what you read! My fast bowlers had a tough game but every time I called on them they came up and gave effort. Never once refused!""
 He captained West Indies in the 2015 World Cup, where they won three out of seven matches. He was also part of the squad that won the 2016 World T20, though he didn't play a game.

In the tournament he was outstanding with bat and ball then in the final against England claimed three wickets and produced the final-ball run out to tie the scores after 50 overs. He was entrusted with the bat in the Super Over and scored 13 off 5 balls including a huge six off Jofra Archer. He was at the non-striker's end for the last ball when Martin Guptill was run out coming back for a second run that would have won New Zealand the World Cup.  
 He made his international debut in a Twenty20 international on New Zealand's tour to South Africa in 2012-13, following some impressive performances in the shorter formats in the domestic season. Neesham began his first-class career with Auckland, but a move Otago worked well for him, as he made some important contributions in the 50-over format in the 2011-12 season, making three 40-plus scores in seven innings, all of them coming at more than a run a ball. He was among the wickets too, taking a career-best 5 for 44 against Wellington and 4 for 23 against Canterbury. The rewards came soon, as he was included in the limited-overs squads for the tour to South Africa and made his T20I and ODI debuts. 
 In February 2014, Neesham made a century on Test debut against India and was at the other end when skipper Brendon McCullum became the first Black Cap to score a Test triple century. He became just the eighth player in Test history to score hundreds in his first two Tests when he made a century against West Indies in Jamaica.
 He narrowly missed the cut for the home World Cup in 2015, an experience he described as ""gut-wrenching"", when Grant Elliott was preferred at the last minute. Neesham found himself in the stands at Eden Park as Elliott struck that iconic six against South Africa to secure a spot in the final.
 Neesham was part of the one-day side over the next two seasons but was dropped after the 2017 Champions Trophy. He was ready to retire but was talked out of it and asked instead to take a break from the game. He returned in 2018 and dominated domestic one-day cricket scoring 503 runs at an average of 62.87 with a strike rate of 110.79, which earned him an international recall to face Sri Lanka. He made 47 not out from 13 balls and 64 from 37 in his first two ODIs back in January 2019 and locked up his 2019 World Cup spot.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222377.html"",""James Neesham"")"	New Zealand

He was 22 years old at the time. 
 Born in Lahore and a first cousin to the Akmal brothers, Azam made his way up through age-group cricket. His journey began at an under-15 world championship in 2008 and he played two under-19 World Cups in 2010 and 2012, where he was Pakistan's top run-scorer.
 ""We didn't have to guide him, he was on his own, but we were supportive all the way,"" Kamran Akmal said. Azam had the distinction of top scoring regularly in age-group domestic cricket before he was called up to the national side in 2015 and made his debut during the home ODI series against Zimbabwe - a rarity because Azam's rise was during Pakistan's isolation as an international venue due to security concerns. 
 His hat-trick of ODI hundreds against West Indies led to a Test debut in the Test series that followed, and Azam had to opportunity to cement his spot as the careers of Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq wound down."

Mohammed Shami	Mohammed Shami Ahmed	September 3, 1990, Amroha, Uttar Pradesh 	30 years 178 days	India, Bengal, Delhi Daredevils, ICC World XI, India A, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders	Bowler	Right-hand bat	Right-arm fast	25	India v Pakistan at Delhi, Jan 6, 2013	"Mohammed Shami was India's leading fast bowler in the 2015 World Cup in Australia, when the team marched into the semi-finals and picked up 77 out of 80 wickets on offer. It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new.  
 There were plenty of frustrating times as well. Shami was hopeful of a return to the Indian team in early 2016, but a hamstring injury ruled him out a limited-overs tour of Australia and the Asia Cup in February. He was selected in a 15-man squad for the World T20 in March, but was unable to break into the XI having spent a year out of international cricket. 
 Shami hails from Uttar Pradesh, but plays first-class cricket for Bengal from where he was noticed. He had played only 15 first-class and 15 List A games when he was drafted into India's ODI team to play Pakistan in Delhi in January 2013. He showed the faith wasn't misplaced and returned figures of 9-4-23-1 in a 10-run win, thus becoming only the eighth bowler, and the first Indian, to bowl four or more maiden overs on his ODI debut. His Test debut, which happened in November that year against the touring West Indies, was even more spectacular. He reverse-swung the old ball appreciably,  and at good pace, in the two-match series to take 11 wickets at 16.54. In the summer that followed in England, Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, recorded the second-highest 10th wicket partnership for India in Tests, when they put on 111 runs against England in Nottingham. 
 Shami's quick promotion to international cricket was the result of impressive performances in the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy: in five matches he took 28 wickets at 21.35, including two ten-wicket hauls, against Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad. He has also enjoyed early success in the Twenty20 format, picking up 14 wickets in his first eight domestic Twenty20 games, and was signed by Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2011 IPL season. He got his first game for them in 2013, and was acquired by Delhi Daredevils in 2014, who retained him in 2016 despite his missing the entire 2015 season with injury.

A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his older colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and his challenge was to take that white-ball form and perform just as consistently with the red ball. Starc struggled to gain the consistent backing of the selectors early in his Test career and was often in one Test and out the next, but in 2015 he finally enjoyed a solid run of Test cricket until an ankle injury stopped him during the home summer. His career-best match haul of 11 for 94 came in the notable surroundings of Galle - albeit in an Australia defeat - and he claimed 22 wickets in four Tests during the 2017-18 Ashes. He took his 200th Test wicket in his 50th Test in February of 2019 joining an elite group of Australian bowlers. Also a powerful lower-order batsman, Starc fell one short of a Test century in Mohali in 2013. Starc is married to Australia women's wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy.

When it is a young legspinner the hype is magnified. When it is a young spinner of Pakistani extraction, brought up in Yorkshire, the sense of excitement becomes palpable. Adil Rashid, the player who above all symbolized Yorkshire's growing success in fostering strong relationships in its minority ethnic communities, burst onto the scene with six wickets against Warwickshire on his first-class debut in 2006 at Scarborough. There was a sense in Yorkshire's much-loved seaside town that afternoon as Rashid cut through Warwickshire that a historic breakthrough had been made and more than one Yorkshire supporter observed Rashid's performance with hearts uplifted. 
 A decade later, as he left a tour of India in which England had been trounced 4-0, it was still occasionally possible to see the vulnerable, taciturn 18-year-old of whom Yorkshire were so protective. Rashid had 10 Test caps, all of them in the UAE or South Asia where England needed a second spinner, but even on such surfaces he needed careful handling in case his leg spin succumbed under the pressure. He seemed happiest in limited-overs cricket where the game unfolded in a more predictable fashion and he knew that batsmen would be committed to attack. It was hard to imagine him as a single spinner in England unless he became more serviceable, but such had been remarked of countless legspinners before him.
 A five-wicket haul on debut against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi after a return of 0 for plenty in the first innings augured well (setting up a short run chase which England narrowly failed to achieve) and he also brushed up well a year later in Dhaka at the start of England's 2016-17 tour of Bangladesh and India. His India series gradually took a turn for the worse, however, the promise of Rajkot and Visakhapatnam giving way to a more pessimistic air - and some hefty figures in the runs column - in Mumbai and Chennai. He had the ability to hoover up a tail at both England and county level; sometimes the problem was getting to it.
 In the limited-overs formats, Rashid was a vital component of England's attack and a first-class average with the bat in the mid-30s told of a player who would not have been consigned to the tail in many England XIs in the past.
 Rashid's also caught the eye early in his career for England Under-19s nd an eight-wicket haul during the second Test against India. But he suffered a stress fracture in his back in the close season which forced him to remodel his action. His profile rose further in 2007 when he struck his maiden Championship century against Worcestershire in August and at the end of the season the Cricket Writers' Club made him their Young Cricketer of the Year. In 2008 he enjoyed his most prolific season with 62 wickets in the County Championship and was a late addition to the squad for the Test series in India. That trip was purely for experience, however, as was the tour to West Indies which followed, but even so his career shone with potential.
 Rashid responded the following season with 545 runs at 68.12, including two hundreds, and picked up 31 wickets at 36.06 in the 2009 first-class season. His statistics in one-day and Twenty20 cricket were more modest, but the selectors held faith in his potential, and he made his England debut during the World Twenty in June of that year. He also played in the post-Ashes one-day series against Australia, but his most notable achievement came with the bat when he scored a quickfire 31 in a narrow defeat at The Oval.
 Rashid was included in the party to tour South Africa in 2009-10, but had a difficult time on the trip. He began amid high hopes that his combination of legspin and promising lower-order batting could cement a permanent role in the side, but his solitary over in the second Twenty20 went for 25, then he bowled three overs for 27 in the second ODI before being left out for a fit-again Graeme Swann. When he was released from the one-day party, James Tredwell, the Kent offspinner, remained on stand-by which suggested Rashid had fallen down the pecking order. 
 Andy Flower, England's coach, rightly suggested that he would benefit from a chance to deepen his game at county level, but progress was not immediate. Yorkshire, by now, were showing signs of disquiet over Rashid's bowling. England had demanded that he bowled much quicker and his confidence and method had deserted him when he returned from international duty. His county form faltered, although he did win a place in the England Lions squad to tour UAE and was called-up briefly for the end of the World Cup campaign.
 At home, Rashid enjoyed his most productive season for Yorkshire in 2010, scoring 732 first-class runs at 45.75 and taking 57 wickets at 31.29. He began the 2011 season with a bang, taking 6 for 77 and 5 for 37 to secure victory against Worcestershire at New Road, the best figures for a leg-spinner in Yorkshire history, but failed to maintain his form, finishing the season with 39 wickets at 43.38. From 10 Championship matches in 2012 he totalled only 16 wickets and 129 runs and his discontent was apparent. 
 Rashid was at a crossroads. But more than 800 Championship runs at 50-plus in 2013 suggested that in his mid-20s not just his batting was maturing, and his bowling became more thoughtful, and dangerous in turn with a good googly particularly evident. Yorkshire's challenge was to bring his career to fruition, to bring him not just success on the field but a general contentment. A career that had begun with so much optimism began to reawaken England's interest again - cagily at first with a Lions recall - as Yorkshire won the title in 2014. The appointment of Trevor Bayliss as coach coincided with his return to the England side for the first time in nearly six years, a string of limited-overs displays being joined by limited success in his first three Tests, against Pakistan on the slow, big turners of the UAE.
 He was a much-loved figure on Yorkshire grounds, contributing to back-to-back Championships in 2014 and 15, and dubbed ""The Hoover"" by the head coach Jason Gillespie. But his request to rest out a title decider against Middlesex at Lord's the following year - he later explained that his grandmother was unwell - exasperated his captain, Andrew Gale. Gale's appointment as Yorkshire's coach at the end of the season suggested that conversation was not entirely finished.

No wonder then that once thrown the new SG ball, Bhuvneshwar can make it hoop around corners, mostly back into the right-hand batsman but he gets it to hold its line often enough to be a genuine threat. Like the other Kumar, though, Bhuvneshwar operates at a middling pace of early 130s, but India weren't spoilt enough for choices to deny him an international debut season at the age of 22, in late 2012. Bhuvneshwar said a roaring hello to international cricket. In his first international over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash of a four-Test series. Apart from the swing, Bhuvneshwar's control of it and his cricketing smartness stand out. It stood out the time when he, as a 19-year-old, worked Sachin Tendulkar over for his first first-class duck in Indian domestic cricket. The cricketing smartness showed with the bat too when he scored 128 batting at No. 8, winning a Duleep Trophy semi-final in 2012-13, just before his selection for India.  
 Bhuvneshwar was one of the lone bright spots in an otherwise wretched tour of England, taking 19 wickets at 26.63, an Indian record for most wickets against England in a Test series. He was dragged down by injury in Australia and played only one game in the 2015 World Cup.Sidharth Monga "	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1223359.html"",""Bhuvneshwar Kumar"")"	India

Bowling is ostensibly Perera's major skill but, often deployed in the lower-middle order, he is also capable of delivering furious finishes to an innings. Perera is particularly severe on spin, which has led to his being used as a pinch-hitter through the middle overs, but he has at times also been weak to quality pace bowling.  
 He is the kind of player for whom form in one discipline usually bleeds into the other. Dropped for the limited-overs series against South Africa in July 2014, but roared back in the following ODI series against Pakistan, getting his bowling and his hitting in order. He struck 78 runs at a rate of 169.56 and claimed a series-high nine wickets at an average of 10.66. 
 Perera has also done well with bat and ball on previous tours to Australia, and has often been at his best against India, memorably slamming the straight six that completed Sri Lanka's World T20 triumph in 2014. His more recent years have been beset by inconsistency but Perera continues to command a place in the side. He has hat-tricks in both ODIs and T20s.
 Perera began his schooling at St Anthony's, Wattala, before accepting a scholarship to join St Joseph's College. It turned out to be a productive move as he teamed up with Angelo Mathews and produced many noteworthy performances in the thriving schools cricket scene. Perera played a key role in helping his school break the hoodoo in the Battle of the Saints (against St Peters College) that lasted more than 35 years. He received his maiden national call-up during Sri Lanka's tour of India in 2009 as an emergency replacement for Mathews. 
 That quickly led to an IPL contract, as he was bought by Chennai Super Kings for $50,000, and he has been one of the few Sri Lanka players to consistently find employment in the competition.Andrew Fidel Fernando"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1099840.html?alt=1"",""Thisara Perera"")"	Sri Lanka

Morris is a bowling allrounder, who often sends the speedgun beyond 140kph and bats fearlessly in the lower-order. He is also a handy slip-fielder, and in that regard, he takes after his father, former Northern Transvaal first-class cricketer Willie.  
 Morris was a late bloomer, who made his first-class debut at 22 and only came to the attention of the national selectors when he was well into his mid-20s. He finished the 2011-12 season as the leading wicket-taker in the domestic T20 competition, with 21 scalps at 12.66 and was picked to play a T20 tri-series in Zimbabwe. 
 Later that year, he showed his skills for his franchise, the Lions, in the 2012 Champions League. Morris combined with the likes of Sohail Tanvir and Dirk Nannes to provide a powerful seam attack and take the team to final of the competition. On the basis of that tournament, he was one of the big buys of IPL and went to Chennai Super Kings for more than 31 times his base price of US$20,000
 Despite his T20 fame, Morris insisted he was not a limited-overs specialist and the numbers backed him up. Morris had a promising 2010-11 first-class season, when he averaged over 60 with the bat, albeit in the provincial, not franchise division, in South Africa. He also led the Lions' charge in the 2012-13 Sunfoil Series and finished with 32 wickets at 16.00 and three years later was rewarded with a Test call-up. 
 In the 2015-16 summer, with South Africa's bowling reserves depleted by injury, Morris debuted at the New Year's Test against England. He made more of an impression as a batsman with 69 in his first match and he took that form into limited-overs' cricket as well. 
 Six days after being picked up by Delhi Daredevils for a millions dollars, Morris proved his worth. He struck 62 off 38 balls to see South Africa draw level in the fourth match of a five-game rubber against England and later took them to a similarly thrilling win in a T20. Morris' bowling did not light up the park in the same way and he struggled through the 2016 World T20.

But few in the Caribbean doubted his talent as a batsman. Clive Lloyd gave him his West Indies cap, and coach Stuart Law insisted that he only needed one innings to get going. The world eventually got to know why the boy from Barbados was rated so highly when he became the first player, in 534 first-class matches, to score a hundred in each innings at Headingley. 
  Hope was 23 at the time, the youngest member of the XI, leading West Indies to victory with scores of 147 and 118 not out. They had been faced with a target of 322 - not since Bradman's Invincibles rocketed to 404 for 3 in 1948 had a team chased that many on Yorkshire's storied turf, and won. Adding to the occasion was the fact West Indies had been dismantled only a week ago, England beating them by an innings and 209 runs to ensure their fans could savour the advent of day-night Test cricket in the country. 
 Hope made his first-class debut in 2012-13, but propelled himself into consideration for the West Indies team after a superb season in 2014-15, when he scored 628 runs in nine matches - he was the fourth-highest run-getter in the tournament.

 He was named in the one-day squad for the tour of England following the retirement of Daniel Vettori after the World Cup as New Zealand searched for another left-arm spin option. Santner was in to cover for the absence of the players at the IPL but made an immediate impression with a well-crafted 94 in a tour game against Somerset. He was handed his ODI debut at Edgbaston having played just 19 List A matches for Northern Districts. ""It's nice to have a left-arm spinner who turns,"" was a quip from the New Zealand camp.
 He made his Test debut later that year in the first ever day-night Test against Australia in Adelaide and made 31 and 45 batting at No.6 in both innings in a low-scoring game. He also took two wickets. Over the next four years his Test opportunities were limited but he became a mainstay in the white-ball teams for the Black Caps. 
 His performances were so impressive that he was bought by the Chennai Super Kings in 2019 IPL to play under Stephen Fleming. He won a game by hitting a six off the last ball of the match against Rajasthan and took 2 for 13 from 4 overs in the IPL final against Mumbai, including the prized scalp of Rohit Sharma. 
 His experience in that cauldron held him in good stead for the 2019 World Cup in England. He bowled a clutch spell in the semi-final win over India, strangling their middle order to help secure a spot in the final against England. 
 Later in the same year he recorded a maiden Test century during an epic partnership with BJ Watling. The 261 they added was New Zealand's highest seventh-wicket stand in history and helped their side to 615-9, their highest Test total against England. The three wickets he claimed in England's second-innings also constituted new Test-best figures and helped New Zealand to a crushing innings victory.

Rahul was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final. Rahul attracted plenty of attention at the subsequent IPL auction, and finally went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs. 1 crore (US$ 166,000 approx.). He was a regular member of their side in the 2014 season, mostly as wicketkeeper-batsman, but his contributions with the bat were steady rather than spectacular. In the long format, however, his technique and application have impressed some of Indian cricket's most respected names. These include Rahul Dravid, with whom Rahul shares not just a name but also a strong rapport, regularly seeking him out for technical and mental advice. Rahul had a middling tour of Australia with the India A team in July-August 2014, getting starts each time he batted in the unofficial Tests but only managing a top score of 52. But his appetite for runs was back to normal by the time the 2014-15 domestic season began, and twin centuries in the Duleep Trophy final earned him a place in India's Test squad on their tour of Australia. 
 A profitable IPL in 2016 set him up to make the Indian ODI and T20 squad that toured Zimbabwe in June, where he became the first batsman from his country to score a century on debut in 50-over cricket.Karthik Krishnaswamy"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1223372.html"",""KL Rahul"")"	India

Miller is a self-styled finisher, who is strong off the front and back foot and eager to swing the arms, as well as a gun fielder.  
 He was schooled at the esteemed Martizburg College and made his first-class debut at 18. Two years later, he was part of a South African A side that took on Bangladesh A and finished as the second highest run-scorer, which earned him a senior call-up. He travelled with South Africa to the West Indies in 2010. He did not do enough to travel to the 2011 World Cup or the 2012 World T20. It was only in 2013 that became a regular at international level, where he was most often deployed as a finisher.
 It took till 2015 for Miller's first ODI century: 130 against West Indies in January, followed swiftly by an unbeaten 138 two matches later which sent him to the World Cup in good form. Miller spent even longer waiting for a milestone in T20I cricket. His first fifty in the format came in March 2016. Both speak more to lack of opportunity in limited-overs cricket, rather than lack of ability. 
 At the IPL, Miller was one of the mainstays of the Kings XI Punjab. So much so that, in 2016, he was appointed the franchise's captain despite his limited experience in the role in South Africa. He led Kwa-Zulu Natal in the Africa Cup T20.

Like many aspiring players from his country, he wanted to emulate Wasim Akram but he didn't have the pace his coaches were looking for. Still, the switch to left-arm spin has worked for him. A capable middle-order batsman as well, he was part of the Pakistan side that won the Youth World Cup in 2006, before captaining them in the next edition.  
 It wasn't until 2015, when the senior team were searching for a replacement for the suspended Saeed Ajmal, that Imad got his shot at international cricket. He spent the intervening period playing league cricket in England and Ireland, which he said was instrumental to his development. Adding to his connection to the UK, Imad was born in Swansea. 
 Also a factor in his rise up the ranks was his first-class experience - he struck a half-century for Islamabad on debut in 2007, took an eight-for in 2013 and clattered a maiden double-hundred in 2014. Imad made his T20I debut when cricket returned to Pakistan six years after the Lahore attack in 2009, and represented his country in the World T20 that followed in 2016.

He took 5 for 68 on a spicy Khettarama deck in that match, dismissing Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in a single spell, before claiming Kohli's wicket in the second innings as well. Achieving appreciable seam movement at a sharp pace, and from a high release point, Rajitha proved to be a penetrative T20 bowler in the following domestic season. He was the second-highest wicket-taker in the Super T20 Provincial Tournament, with 10 scalps in six matches. That performance earned him an international T20 debut, where he claimed two wickets in his first over, against India in Pune.

A year and a half later, while back on tour in Zimbabwe in February 2017, the precocious legspinner fetched the highest ever bid for an Associate player in the IPL Auction. He was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for INR 4 crores (US$ 597,000).  
 In the intervening time, Rashid quickly established himself as an automatic pick for Afghanistan. Not a big turner of the ball, he puts batsmen under constant pressure by bowling quickly through the air, akin to his bowling idol Shahid Afridi, while maintaining a stump-to-stump line. His biggest weapon is a very accurate googly, and should it result in a wicket, don't be surprised if he borrows Afridi's signature ""Star man"" celebration. 
 Rashid is also an athletic fielder, often placed in the covers, a region of high traffic in one-day cricket. With bat in hand, he is more than capable of clearing the boundary late in an innings and has air-brushed many a middling total into a match-winning one for his team. 
 Domestically, Rashid has been a productive force for the Kabul Eagles franchise. He parlayed his success from a superb first season with Sunrisers into franchise deals with Guyana Amazon Warriors - with whom he claimed the CPL's first ever hat-trick in 2017 - and Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash. He continued scaling new heights for Afghanistan as well, taking 5 for 3 in a T20I against Ireland to keep a record 11-match T20I winning streak alive and later in 2017 helped spin his country to victory over West Indies in their maiden ODI in the Caribbean with figures of 7 for 18, the fourth-best haul for anyone in ODI cricket. It all added up to Rashid being honoured as the 2017 ICC Associate Cricketer of the Year. 
 In January 2018, Rashid's status as a global superstar was cemented when he became Afghanistan's first IPL millionaire after Sunrisers reclaimed him at auction for INR 9 crores (US$ 1.4 million). Rashid's charisma has turned him into a crowd favourite at every stop. After showcasing his dominance in franchise leagues and against Associate competition, Afghanistan's promotion to Full Membership and entry into Test cricket is an opportunity for Rashid to demonstrate his ability to be a transcendent figure across all formats.

Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him.  
 Besides, like his Mumbai Indians team-mate, Lasith Malinga, Bumrah carved himself a reputation for possessing an uncanny ability to hit the blockhole. And, it was during his time in the IPL that he learned from the Sri Lankan to judiciously use the yorker.  
 A regular member of the India A team, Bumrah was on the fringes of national selection before a debilitating left knee injury at the end of 2014 kept him out for four-and-a-half months. He had to wait more than a year before earning another call-up, one which came on the back of a fruitful 2015-16 domestic season, where he was Gujarat's second-highest wicket-taker in the Ranji Trophy and topped the bowling charts in the Vijay Hazare Trophy - that included a five-for in the List-A final that gave Gujarat their maiden one-day title. 
 Those performances, and an untimely injury to Mohammed Shami, meant Bumrah took the flight to Australia, where he played a central role for India, finishing as the highest wicket-taker from either side as the visitors swept the T20Is 3-0. It was a showing that earned him the praise of MS Dhoni - who called him the find of the tour - as well as a place in India's squad for the 2016 World T20.ESPNcricinfo staff "	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1220572.html"",""Jasprit Bumrah"")"	India

 He continued with the Under-19 team for a further two years, with occasionally astonishing results such as his spell of 8 for 12 against Oman in the 2011 ACC U19 Elite Cup. He went to his second Youth World Cup in 2012, and also began to play more often for the senior national side.

He started off as a wicketkeeper in age-group cricket, and has continued in the role, although his batting has always been his stronger suit.  
 He is a batsman who prefers to play the long innings, though he has also been known to take the aerial route as he has often batted in the top-order in limited-overs cricket.
 Mithun made his first-class debut in 2006 for Khulna Division, although he remained a regular in the Bangladesh under-19 side. He played in the 2008 U-19 World Cup in Malaysia, after which he took three years to get into the next level, playing for Bangladesh A in their 2011 tour to the West Indies. He had averaged 50.81 in first-class cricket during that season, including three centuries. His next good season was 2013-14, which was also his most productive, as he scored 706 runs in nine matches.
 It prompted a sudden call-up to the Bangladesh T20 side when regular wicketkeeper and captain Mushfiqur Rahim suffered a finger injury in early 2014.

He has benefited from Pakistan's chronic poor luck with fast bowlers: with Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif missing more than they play and Umar Gul injury-prone, Riaz came into national reckoning earlier than he might have reasonably expected. Since then he has had some good moments in international cricket, but consistency hasn't been his strongest suit. 
 On his Test debut, against England at The Oval in 2010, Riaz took 5 for 63, becoming the ninth Pakistan bowler to take five on debut. Among his victims were Andrew Strauss, Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen. However, he had poor tours of New Zealand and West Indies in 2011, and was dropped from the Test side.
 As an ODI bowler he has been a wicket-taker but has also leaked plenty of runs. His ODI best came in a big game, when he took 5 for 46 against India in the World Cup semi-final in Mohali - among his wickets were Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni - but it wasn't enough to prevent defeat.

A right-handed opening batsman, Guptill has consistently been among the runs in ODIs notably making a double-century in the quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup, but has struggled to make a mark in Tests. 
 One of the reasons he hasn't had success in the longest format is his preference to play with hard hands and drive on the up. With the red ball's tendency to move more than the white one, and pitches for multi-day cricket being more responsive to swing and seam, Guptill has not been the force he could have been in Tests and has not played a Test match since 2016. Fairly odd for a man who plays some of the most pristine straight-bat shots. 
 Guptill showed he had it in him to dominate all formats, winning the Richard Hadlee Medal in 2011-12 along with being named ODI and T20 player of the year at the New Zealand Cricket awards. He claimed the latter two back in 2015-16 thanks in no small part to the 237 not out he made against West Indies in Wellington during the 2015 World Cup, the second-highest ODI score of all time. He was also the tournament's leading scorer with 547 runs, just ahead of two all-time greats in Kumar Sangakkara and AB de Villiers. 
 In 2018, he become New Zealand's fourth player to reach 6000 ODI runs and entered the 2019 World Cup in red-hot form but failed to have the impact he did in 2015.  Despite his struggles, New Zealand entrusted him with batting in the Super Over in the thrilling final against England. The only ball he faced was the last, with two runs to win, he was run out agonisingly short of the winning second run that would have handed New Zealand the World Cup. 
 The first time Guptill gained recognition was in 2007-08, topping the overall State Shield run-charts. His efforts took Auckland to the final, and he carried his purple patch into the Emerging Players tournament in Australia, finishing as New Zealand's highest scorer. That earned him a call-up to the A side and then to the ODI and Test squads. 
 His growth as a player on the world stage was highlighted by the contracts given to him by Derbyshire and Lancashire in the English county, Sydney Thunder in the Australian Big Bash League, Mumbai Indians, Kings XI Punjab and Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL, St Kitts and Nevis Patriots and Guyana Amazon Warriors, who made him captain for the 2016 edition of the Caribbean Premier League.ESPNcricinfostaff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222454.html"",""Martin Guptill"")"	New Zealand

He led South Africa's Under-19s to World Cup glory in 2014 and was also their leading run-scorer and third overall. Despite that success, Markram had to bide his time before earning a professional contract. He returned home to play for the University of Pretoria and Northerns, and in the 2016-17 season was part of the Titans squad.  
 A batsman of class and composure, strong on the offside and aggressive in nature, Markram was seen as someone who could change a sometimes conservative South African approach to batting.
 Under Mark Boucher's guidance, Markram excelled and averaged over 50 in both the first-class and fifty-over competitions. He was named in South Africa's A side to tour the UK in June 2016, and as their captain in the longer formats.

He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four.  
 A highly-rated graduate of Sri Lanka's school cricket system, Mendis' batting had earned him a large following long before he was on the national selectors' radar. As wicketkeeper and flowing right-hand batsman, Mendis won the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2013, for his work in the Prince of Wales College team. He was Sri Lanka's under-19 captain in the Youth World Cup the following year.
 Mendis began his first-class career for Bloomfield Cricket Club in the Premier League Tournament of 2015. He had a middling first season, hitting 459 runs at an average of 30.60, but continued to be followed closely as Sri Lanka moved to flood their Test team with youth. It was Mendis' excellent returns in the Moin-ud-Dowlah three-day tournament in Hyderabad that paved his route to the national team. He was named in the squad to play West Indies in October 2015, and made his debut in the second match of that series.Andrew Fidel Fernando"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222669.html"",""Kusal Mendis"")"	Sri Lanka

The international grounding and a backyard net helped develop Marsh into one of the finest, if not enigmatic, talents in Australian cricket. The elegant left-hander made his first-class debut for Western Australia as a 17-year-old and scored a century as a 19-year-old against New South Wales in 2003 in a game where then Test veterans Steve and Mark Waugh were playing. He eventually progressed to international ranks making a successful start to his ODI career in 2008 and scoring a superb century on Test debut in Sri Lanka in 2011.  
 Marsh looked set for a lengthy tenure as Australia's No.3 but a back injury suffered during Australia's disastrous Cape Town Test later that year proved a serious setback. Marsh rejoined the side for the home Tests against India but was a shadow of himself, and 17 runs from six innings was a calamitous return. He went into a tailspin that saw him dropped from WA's Sheffield Shield side before Justin Langer's arrival as WA coach resurrected his career. He was recalled for the 2014 Test tour of South Africa and scored 148 at Centurion, but was dropped again after making a pair in the next Test.  Another recall came at home against India when Michael Clarke was injured, and 99 at the MCG suggested he still had something to offer. 
 But in his only Test on the 2015 Ashes tour he scored 0 and 2, and it seemed that might have been his last chance. Until he was given another, included to replace the injured Usman Khawaja for the inaugural day-night Test against New Zealand in 2015-16. Permanency has never arrived, however, through a mixture of form and injury. It felt as though the 2017-18 Ashes promised something better with two hundreds in the series, including one against the pink ball in Adelaide, but there was a subsequent slump in form that again that saw him dropped from the Test side after the 2018-19 home series loss to India. 
 Marsh remains one of the great enigmas of Australian cricket. Despite his incredible peaks and troughs in form Australian selection panels continually view him as a viable top-order prospect in Tests and ODIs especially. While his poor Test run in 2018-19 led to his eventual omission from the team, his ODI form was impressive, making four ODI centuries in 12 months to get himself into the 2019 World Cup squad. He was also handed a CA contract for 2019-20 aged 35 and only playing in the ODI team. 
 He has been an outstanding T20 franchise player despite not playing much T20 international cricket and was the leading run-scorer and named Player of the IPL in 2008 for Kings XI Punjab. He was the leading run-scorer in BBL 02, helping Perth Scorchers to the final, and made 63 and 73 in the finals of both BBL 03 and BBL 04 to help the Scorchers to back-to-back titles. In 2019 he left the Scorchers and signed a three-year deal with the Melbourne Renegades.

He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup.  
 He made his first-class debut for Khulna in the 2013-14 season and, after taking eight wickets in the U-19 World Cup in the UAE, he was surprisingly picked for Bangladesh A's tour of West Indies. Returning from that short trip, he was viewed as a better bowler and slowly picked up more variations. He initially lacked pace but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets at an average of 19.08. 
 This was when Mustafizur started to develop the left-armer's offcutter, which was delivered as a spinner does but with the added ability of making it carry to the wicketkeeper standing back. The story of Anamul Haque's dare that got him to bowl the delivery will go into Bangladeshi cricket folklore, as will the early support he received from Mashrafe Mortaza, who spotted him randomly in the Mirpur nets.
 Soon enough, the Bangladesh selectors picked Mustafizur for the one-off T20I against Pakistan and then, midway through 2015, for the ODI series against India when he became only the second bowler after Brian Vitori to take five-wicket hauls in his first two ODIs, paving the way for Bangladesh's first-ever ODI series win over India.
 He was excellent in bilateral series against South Africa - which included a Test debut - and Zimbabwe, while also doing well in his first BPL campaign. Mustafizur's first foray on to the world stage was through the IPL auction, when he was picked Sunrisers Hyderabad in early 2016, followed by confirmation of a contract with Sussex for English domestic limited-overs cricket. He ensured none of his new paymasters doubted their call as he emerged as one of the best bowlers in the World T20, signing off with a five-wicket haul against New Zealand, bamboozling them with his variation of cutters.

He first represented them at the end of the 2010-11 season, when he was just 21. His ability to bowl at pace - in the 140s kph - and swing the ball was what caught the eye.  
 Hendricks developed into a prospect for the future in the 2012-13 season when he was a regular member of the Cobras set-up. Bowling alongside the likes of Johann Louw and Charl Langeveldt, he learnt from experience and was the fifth highest-wicket-taker of the first-class season with 35 scalps at 17.74. 
 He was selected as part of South Africa A's 2013 winter programme and prospered on flat pitches.

The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred paceman who became one of the standout players in the world. 
 Cummins burst onto the scene with a sensational Test debut, taking a match total of seven wickets to set up a thrilling two-wicket win to square the series against South Africa at the Wanderers. He had made his debut for New South Wales during the 2010-11 season and was particularly impressive in his maiden Big Bash season - topping the bowling charts with 11 wickets at 14.09, conceding only 6.59 runs an over. Touted to be a future leader of Australia's pace attack, he was offered a central contract for 2011-12, becoming the youngest player to be contracted since the current system was introduced in 1998. 
 Then came the injuries. He suffered repeated stress fractures in his lower back and did not play another Test for six years, until the 2017 tour of India. But all the pain and rehab of those intervening years appeared to have been worthwhile as his body toughened up to the rigours of international cricket.
 In the wake of Australia's ball-tampering scandal he became arguably the nation's shining light in a cricketing sense. He was absent through the various 2018 winter tours immediately after the controversy due to a back injury but was monumental in the losing home series against India and was subsequently rewarded with the Test vice-captaincy against Sri Lanka. He became the No. 1 ranked Test bowler in the world and claimed Australia's coveted Allan Border Medal as the 2018-19 men's cricketer of the year.  He formed a formidable pace attack alongside Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and latterly James Pattinson and was a standout part of retaining the Ashes on English soil in 2019.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1232594.html"",""Pat Cummins"")"	Australia

At well under six feet, he doesn't have the height of some of the earlier West Indian greats, but he has extreme pace, consistently touching the late 140s (kph), and can skid on to batsmen quicker than they realise. 
 Roach burst into international cricket with 13 wickets in his first two Tests, against Bangladesh, but made his name on the tour of Australia in 2009-10. Consistently bowling at around 150kph, he hurried most of the Australian batsmen and made the headlines in the Perth Test, forcing Ricky Ponting to retire hurt after hitting him on the elbow with a pacy 146kph delivery. In the 2010 IPL auction, he was bought by Deccan Chargers for a healthy sum of $720,000, but it's in the longer format that he holds the greatest promise, a fact that was confirmed by his ten-wicket haul in two Tests in Sri Lanka in 2010-11. He picked up his maiden ten-wicket haul in Tests in 2012 against Australia in Trinidad.
 By the end of 2014, Roach seemed set to fulfill his promise, with a bowling average in the mid-20s and a strike rate below 50 after 29 Tests. An ankle injury suffered during the Centurion Test in December 2014, however, slowed him down - in both senses of the term. Significantly down on pace after his recovery and return, he took just nine wickets in eight Tests that included a tour of England, and home and away series against Australia. He was left out ahead of the 2016 home Tests against India. Having to prove himself all over again in domestic cricket, Roach took 23 wickets at 16.17 in the 2016-17 Professional Cricket League, and was back in West Indies' Test squad for their 2017 tour of England.ESPNcricinfo Staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1225945.html?alt=1"",""Kemar Roach"")"	West Indies

But the fade of his Australian football career around his 20th birthday left him to fall back on the other sport that had competed for his junior attention, starting a road to becoming Australia's limited-overs wicketkeeper and vice-captain.  
 Carey had always been highly regarded by South Australia, for whom he turned out at age-group levels in addition to his club side Glenelg. On returning home from Sydney, Carey excelled in grade ranks as a batsman, but found the going harder when first chosen for the Redbacks in early 2013. These struggles led the adaptable Carey to make another switch, from full-time batsman to wicketkeeper-batting down the order, and it was in this form that he was able to progress. Amid a strong club and 2nd XI season in 2015-16, he displaced Tim Ludeman as South Australia's gloveman, and earned strong reviews for his precise footwork, soft hands and promising, elegant batting. 
 He took 57 Sheffield Shield catches and two stumpings in 2016-17 and was in the selectors' thoughts entering the 2017-18 Ashes, only to be nipped out of a baggy green by the return of the older, wiser Tim Paine. Nevertheless, he gained an ODI debut against England when Paine was ill, following a impressive BBL season for Adelaide Strikers where his explosive runs at the top of the order propelled the Strikers to the title. 
 He became the T20I wicketkeeper for Australia in a successful tri-series victory in early 2018 and he was then taken on the ODI tour of England as a back-up keeper and spare batsman. He quickly replaced Paine in the ODI team and remarkably became vice-captain of both limited-overs teams in the aftermath of Australian cricket's cultural review, cementing his place for the 2019 ODI World Cup.ESPNCricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1186409.html"",""Alex Carey"")"	Australia

It took the exposure of the PSL for Asif Ali to come to prominence in an Islamabad United side that owed much to him for their title-winning campaign in 2018. A six in a Super Over against Mustafizur Rahman got their campaign up and running, and it wasn't until he smashed three sixes in arrow in a nerve-wracking chase that his side were assured victory.  
 Those heroics saw him called up to the national side for three T20Is against West Indies, where he made the step-up with consummate ease. Clear about his role in the team, he's already played several vital cameos in the shortest format to get his side over the line, with a strike rate around 160 proof of his comfort at the highest level. 
 As a finisher in ODI cricket, he similarly impresses, although he may have to move lower down the order if Pakistan's middle order fragility continues; his power hitting exploits are not best suited for the No. 6 position. But what's most important is he fills a very specific need within the team, and if the first few months are anything to go by, he fills it very well indeed. 
 Given he is 26 and has a strike rate above 140 in 88 T20s, it does seem a bit of a scouting failure Asif wasn't given a promotion to the national side a few years earlier, when much of Pakistan's struggles in T20 and ODI cricket were to do with lack of firepower in the death overs. It bodes well for Pakistan he's hit the ground running, eager to make up for lost time.

He was still only 19, with only one T20I cap behind him, and fresh from a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup when he was handed a Test debut against England in Napier. Southee responded with 5 for 55 before smashing 77 off 40 balls in the second innings with nine sixes. 
 It was a debut that gave a clear indication of the career to come. Over the next decade or so, Southee would go on to form one of the world's best new-ball partnerships with Trent Boult, and would also come to be known for his ability to clear the fence. He hit his 50th six in only his 36th Test, and could one day take the Test record for most sixes from his long-time captain Brendon McCullum.
 Pace and outswing, however, are the main tools of Southee's trade. His bag of 18 wickets at 17.33 in the 2011 World Cup prompted Allan Donald to say he had the potential to become the best swing bowler in the world, and though frequent injury-forced absences have kept him from fulfilling that prophecy, he has shown he can be devastating across a wide range of conditions.
 In 2012, he showed his adaptability in the subcontinent, picking up 7 for 64 in Bangalore, the best figures for a New Zealand bowler in India, before bowling his side to a rare win in Sri Lanka with match figures of 8 for 120 at the P Sara Oval. Two years later, his 11 wickets in the West Indies, at 21.09, helped New Zealand achieve their first series win away from home, against anyone other than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe, in 12 years. In ODIs, his landmark performance came at the 2015 World Cup, when he sliced through England's batting with a sensational spell of swing bowling to finish with figures of 7 for 33, the best bowling figures for a New Zealander in ODIs.
 Such is his standing in New Zealand cricket, Southee was elevated as a stand in captain in a T20I in 2017 and then an ODI in 2018. But despite standing in as captain and remaining a key Test and T20 bowler, he fell out of favour in the ODI side due to the form of Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson and only played one match in the 2019 World Cup.

Outstanding form in the 2015 Premier League Tournament prompted his elevation. He was the first-class season's top scorer with 1144 runs at an average of 67.29, and had also claimed 20 wickets for Badureliya Cricket Club.  
 Siriwardana showcased his attacking flair when he made his ODI and T20 debuts during Pakistan's mid-year tour of Sri Lanka, and memorably struck his first international fifty in 25 deliveries during a breakneck 114-run ODI stand with Angelo Mathews. A successful initiation in those formats paved the route to his Test debut against West Indies later the same year. 
 He had made his first-class debut for Sebastianites Cricket and Athletic Club in 2005, and had played for Sri Lanka A for several years before getting his international break. Siriwardana came close to national recognition was when he was included in the 30-member provisional squad for the 2009 World T20, but he was left out of the final team. That call-up came close on the heels of his maiden first-class ton, 135 for Basnahira South against Ruhuna in the SLC Inter-Provincial Tournament, a match in which he also claimed five wickets.Andrew Fidel Fernando"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222676.html"",""Milinda Siriwardana"")"	Sri Lanka
James Vince	James Michael Vince	March 14, 1991, Cuckfield, Sussex 	29 years 351 days	England, Auckland, England Lions, England Performance Programme, England Under-19s, Hampshire, Hampshire, Hampshire 2nd XI, Hampshire 2nd XI, Karachi Kings, Maratha Arabians, Multan Sultans, Northamptonshire, Paarl Rocks, Sydney Sixers, Sydney Thunder, Team James Vince, Wiltshire, Wiltshire	Batsman	Right-hand bat	Right-arm medium	51	Ireland v England at Dublin (Malahide), May 8, 2015	"With a wide range of strokes and an ability to time the ball shared by few, it was understandable that England's selectors kept providing opportunities to James Vince. 
 Despite a supporting role in the World Cup triumph - he won a late call-up as first reserve batsmen when the team management lost patience with Alex Hales and went on to play three matches in the tournament - there was still a sense that, after more than 30 international appearances and despite his undoubted elegance, Vince has promised rather more than has delivered in several opportunities in the England side. 
 Vince was first given the summer of 2016 to prove that he had the ability to succeed at England level. Sadly, appearances - initially at least - proved misleading. In seven Tests, against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, he averaged 19.27 without a half-century and was repeatedly fallible on the drive outside off stump. Only one Championship hundred for Hampshire added to his mournful air. Vince did manage an ODI half-century against Sri Lanka and showed more promise in T20Is, but those who had lobbied long and hard for his inclusion were particularly disappointed with the outcome of his first international summer as his undoubted style was not matched by substance. Even then they insisted that statistics showed that his ill luck was that he tended to play and edge rather than play and miss.
 But Vince was not to be denied so easily - or at least Vince's advocates weren't. He only averaged 33 in the Championship in 2017, but still found himself on the plane to Australia after England's selectors observed the failure of Tom Westley, and others, to make the No 3 position their own and turned to Vince once again. Simmering talent or habitual maker of soft 20s and 30s? It seemed that England were about to find out.
 He began with an impressive 83 in Brisbane before he was run out, but only passed 50 once in his next eight innings. Despite 76 in Christchurch in a drawn Test in New Zealand, he was axed again in the English summer even though England were struggling for top-order options. England's new national selector, Ed Smith, seemed to want proof of desire at Hampshire. He responded with 201 from 437 balls against Somerset at Taunton but was overlooked all the same, he topped Hampshire's averages, and his 50-over cricket included a sublime 171 against Yorkshire but his defiance waned and he ended the season feebly with no score above 30 in his last nine innings.
 A Wiltshire boy who found his way into the Hampshire set up, he was first tipped as a star of the future when the former England coach Duncan Fletcher, who worked with Vince at the Hampshire academy, said he was reminiscent of Michael Vaughan. Like Vaughan, an adherence to sound technique does little to temper his attacking instincts. To attract England's interest more regularly, though, he needed to answer a perception that he suffers a greater proportion of soft dismissals than a player of his ability should.
 Vince has enjoyed one-day success with Hampshire, his red ball cricket has slowly advanced and he has been a regular in the England Lions squad, impressing with his methodical approach.
 After he broke into the Hampshire side in 2009 he averaged over 50 in his first round of limited-overs matches before impressing again for England at the Under-19 World Cup. He became a First XI regular in 2010, and in August of that year confirmed his pedigree with an innings of 180 against a Yorkshire attack that included Ajmal Shahzad, Tim Bresnan and Adil Rashid at Scarborough. In that innings he added 278 with Jimmy Adams, breaking Hampshire's fourth-wicket record which had stood since 1970. 
 Vince went past 1000 career runs for Hampshire while still a teenager - the second youngest player in the county's history behind Phil Mead to do so. In 2012 he averaged 55.50 as Hampshire won the Clydesdale Bank 40, the second part of a one-day double. 2013 saw great improvement in the County Championship and he passed 1000 first-class runs in a season for the first time. That winter he toured Sri Lanka with England Lions and during the following close season in 2014-15, was picked for the Lions trip to South Africa.
 Vince enjoyed a stand-out season in 2014 after being named Hampshire vice-captain. He made a mighty 1525 runs - the highest tally in the country - at 61.00 as Hampshire won Division Two of the County Championship and also made a superb 93 from just 51 balls to steer his side to victory in a T20 quarter-final at Notts. 
 His career progressed substantially in 2015 when he made his England one-day debut against Ireland in May and was named as captain of the Lions T20 squad to face Pakistan A in Dubai in December. He also assumed the Hampshire captaincy in all formats at only 24, hailed by his chairman Rod Bransgrove as ""a genuinely gifted and creative captain with a maturity beyond his years.""
 Ahead of the 2015 season it was announced that Vince would become captain for both limited-overs formats, assuming the 50-over captaincy from Jimmy Adams. By the end of the summer, he had replaced Adams in all three formats only for his career to falter when England came calling.

It is not just his power that worries opposing bowlers and captains. His ability to make unconventional shots appear routine - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. 
 In 2017-18 his career entered a confusing stage as he was dropped from the ODI side and then told by new Australia coach Justin Langer to ""go and make hundreds"" without seemingly being given the opportunities to do so. However, he re-established himself in ODI and T20I sides playing some stunning innings on the tours of India and the UAE. He scored his third T20I century in Bangalore to help Australia chase down 194. 
 Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fieldsman, he offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click. He made his name for Victoria with a 19-ball half-century against Tasmania in 2010-11, the fastest fifty in Australia's one-day domestic history, and transferred that talent to the international stage. At the 2015 World Cup he blasted a 51-ball hundred against Sri Lanka at the SCG, the fastest for Australia in ODIs and the second-quickest in World Cup history. 
 Australia have also used Maxwell in Tests but to less effect - patience at the crease has not generally been one of his strengths. However, in Delhi in 2013 he had the distinction of opening the batting and bowling in the same Test, as Australia searched in vain for something to turn their disastrous series around. He scored a maiden Test century against India in 2017 in Ranchi but was dropped following the 2017 tour of Bangladesh. He made a career-best 278 for Victoria against New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield in 2017-18 but could not find a spot in a revamped Australian Test side post the ball-tampering scandal.

He made his first-class debut at the age of 19 and impressive against Lahore Ravi with a four-wicket haul in the first innings. His career started with club cricket and rose up to the regional Under-16 level but he did not make youth squads at national level. However, he managed to gain some attention in the 2015 National T20 Cup in where he picked up eight wickets in four matches under the captaincy of Shoaib Malik. His 17 wickets at 17.05 in the National One-Day cup in 2016 was a key part of him being promoted to the Pakistan side. Peshawar Zalmi head coach Mohammad Akram had been monitoring this process at the domestic circuit and snapped him form the emerging category in Pakistan Super League. 
 Hasan made a smooth transition to international cricket, grabbing two five-fors in his first 15 ODIs and impressing with his tight lines on his Test debut - which coincided with the farewells of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan - as Pakistan pulled off a last-gasp win in Dominica. Still, no one could quite imagine the impact he would have on his first global tournament, the 2017 Champions Trophy.
 Much like his team, Hasan began the tournament badly, going for 70 in his ten overs in a heavy opening-match defeat to India, before turning his form around in unexpectedly dramatic manner. Taking three wickets in each of Pakistan's next four matches, he finished as the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 13 at an average of 14.69, while only conceding 4.29 an over. Hasan's ability to strike regular middle-overs blows was a key factor in Pakistan lifting their first global ODI trophy since the 1992 World Cup, and his Player-of-the-Tournament award richly deserved.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221116.html"",""Hasan Ali"")"	Pakistan

In late 2012, he was the star who derailed West Indies to their first ODI series defeat in Bangladesh, and was a step away from captaincy. A poor season later, his place was continually questioned and he was even dropped for the 2014 Asia Cup. After another five months, Mahmudullah finally found form and became an automatic choice. 
 Born in Mymensingh, a district located 115km to the north of Dhaka, Mahmudullah learned his game in his hometown before coming to the capital to take part in the ACC U15 tournament in 2000. He played in the 2004 U19 World Cup at home, and the following year made his first-class debut for Bangladesh A. He also spent part of that year in the MCC Young Cricketers and became a regular club and first-class cricketer back home in the 2005-06 season.
 He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in 2007 and was labeled a limited-overs specialist for some time and he delivered in short bursts, hardly setting the world on fire. But his eight-wicket haul on Test debut (including a five-for in the second innings) against West Indies in 2009 spurred him on as he suddenly averaged 193 with the bat in the ODI tri-series against India and Sri Lanka later that year.
 It got better as he slammed his one and only international hundred, in a one-off Test against New Zealand in Hamilton. The crowd held their breath as he drove the fast bowlers imperiously through the covers, fleetingly drawing comparisons with India's VVS Laxman. His most telling contribution so far has been the 159 runs he made against West Indies in the home ODI series in 2012. He was holding the innings together as well as playing the match-winning role. The next two years were a struggle, but after a reasonable performance against Zimbabwe in the 2014 winter, he confirmed his place in the 2015 World Cup squad.Mohammad Isam"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1099653.html"",""Mahmudullah"")"	Bangladesh

In the process, he played for more than 25 teams, including four English counties, three South African franchises and an IPL team while carving a reputation as one of the best limited-overs' legspinners of his time. A feisty character with a celebration longer than most fast-bowlers' run-ups and a range of variations, Tahir made the googly his biggest weapon in the limited-overs formats. 
 That was not always what Tahir was being primed for. When he arrived in South Africa, after meeting his wife Sumayya during the 1998 Under-19 World Cup, he established himself in the first-class set-up. He was the third highest wicket-taker in the 2008-09 first-class competition and was called up to the South African Test squad in January 2010 during their home series against England.
 However, later the same day the decision was overturned after it became clear Tahir was not yet eligible to play for South Africa. Tahir went back to the domestic circuit and consistently picked up wickets in the 2010-11 season, when he also became a citizen. Less than a week after he was naturalised, he was picked in South Africa's squad for the one-dayers against India. But he had to wait until the 2011 World Cup for his debut and he made an immediate impact. He finished the tournament as South Africa's second-highest wicket-taker. 
 That summer, Tahir made his Test debut against Australia in Cape Town, in the same match as Vernon Philander. Despite all the hype around how he would complete South Africa's attack, Tahir struggled for the same success he had at the domestic level in a pace-heavy pack and on pitches unsuitable for his style of bowling. In his 11th Test, against Australia in Adelaide in November 2012, it seemed the experiment was over. Tahir's figures were 0 for 260, the most expensive returns without a wicket in Test history, and he was dropped.
 He remained out of contention in all formats until South Africa's tour to the UAE in October 2013, where he would play against his former countrymen. Tahir took his first Test five-for in Dubai but it did not earn him a more permanent place. Instead, he carved a niche for himself in the shorter formats, where he showed much more control with his craft. 
 Tahir earned a reputation for being able to contain the middle-periods of matches while also taking wickets, and his rise coincided with South Africa's limited-overs recovery, especially after the 2015 World Cup. Tahir was even more effective in the 20-over format and by April 2016 had risen to No.2 on the ICC bowler rankings.

His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career. 
 Shadab has made an immediate impact; he only played his maiden first-class game ten months ago, in July 2016. His ability with the U-19 side caught PSL franchise Islamabad United's eye, who gave the young leggie a chance he accepted with aplomb. His performance during the competition won him praise from the likes of Wasim Akram and Misbah-ul-Haq, and saw him called up to Pakistan's limited-overs side for the tour to the West Indies. His meteoric rise continued as he flourished in the first two T20Is, taking seven wickets for 21 runs and winning the Man-of-the-Match award on both occasions."

 Born and brought up in Feni, a small town 176km south-east of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, Saifuddin's life as a cricketer took off when he was included in Bangladesh's Under-19 side in 2013. He had a productive Under-19 Youth ODI career, taking 45 wickets at 21.75 with one five-wicket haul. 
 His best performance at the Under-19 World Cup in 2016 grabbed the selectors' attention and ensured the powers-that-be in the Bangladesh Cricket Board took interest in him. 
 He had already made his first-class debut in 2014 although, after the 2016 World Cup, injury troubles and being reported for suspect action during the Dhaka Premier League - the domestic List-A competition - held him back. He was cleared later in the off-season, and in the 2017 league, took 25 wickets for Abahani Limited from 16 innings.
 He made his T20 international debut against Sri Lanka in April 2017 before earning his maiden ODI call-up in South Africa, where he debuted in the first ODI of the series.Mohammad Isam"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221730.html"",""Mohammad Saifuddin"")"	Bangladesh

Duminy is best known for his cover drive, square cut, quick wrists and athletic fielding. With more than a decade of international cricket to his name, his most prized accomplishment was becoming South Africa's leading T20 run-scorer, in 2013, as well as the first from the country to amass 1500 runs in the format. 
 Duminy made his ODI debut in 2004 but had a forgettable run with two ducks in five innings and was only recalled two years later. In 2006, he made 60 on comeback against Zimbabwe, but it was not enough to send him to the 2007 World Cup. 
 His big break came, ironically, through a team-mate's injury when Ashwell Prince broke his thumb before the first Test of the 2008-09 tour of Australia. His unbeaten second-innings 50 helped South Africa to victory in Perth before a serene 166 in Melbourne set up their series win. Prince only regained his place in the team months later as Duminy became the new poster boy. His performances earned him a lucrative US$950,000 deal with Mumbai Indians in 2009. 
 The Midas touch faded in 2010 when four successive single-digit scores saw Duminy dropped from the Test team. He remained an important part of the limited-overs set-up, however, and was part of the 2011 World Cup squad. 
 He was recalled to the Test side two years later and scored a century against New Zealand apart from playing a part in South Africa claiming the Test mace in August 2012. Then, his career was interrupted when, on the tour to Australia later that year, he tore his Achilles' tendon that forced him out for seven months. 
 He recovered in time for the 2013 Champions Trophy and scored 150* - bettering his previous highest in the process - against Netherlands in preparation, but had a quiet tournament. All told, none of Duminy's four ODI centuries has come against top-eight opposition. 
 2014 was his most productive Test year, with centuries against Australia and Sri Lanka, but his form tapered after that. After playing an important part in the 2015 T20 series win in India, he picked up a finger injury, which kept him out of two ODIs and a Test on that tour. 
 When he recovered, Duminy found it difficult to balance the responsibility of being used as a part-time bowler with holding the middle order together. As a result, both disciplines seemed to suffer. He also struggled with a hamstring problem during the 2016 World T20.

He scored six fifties and one century during the 2008-09 first-class season and those who have seen him bat for Maharashtra rate him as a natural Twenty20 player. Initially a part of the Royal Challengers Bangalore development squad, he was drafted in by Delhi, for whom his innings against Bangalore was a shot in the arm in a struggling season. He eventually returned to the Bangalore franchise in 2016.  
 In the Ranji Trophy, he made a name for himself in 2013-14, finishing as the season's highest run-getter with 1223 runs including six centuries. He was one of the few bright spots in Daredevils' failed campaign in 2014 and his fulfilling season earned him an India call-up for the Bangladesh ODIs in June 2014. But he didn't make his debut till November that year, slotting in at No. 6 against Sri Lanka. His next two stints in the ODI squad were tours to Zimbabwe, one in July 2015 - where he scored an unbeaten century - and one in June 2016, where he didn't get to bat during any of India's three chases. This sporadic relation with the Indian team was finally cut short when he featured in all five ODIs against New Zealand at home in October 2016. His performances as the last recognized batsman in a team playing five bowlers - along with a newly-adopted skill in offspin - earned him a call up for the England series in January 2017, along with a semblance of security as an Indian player.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1220816.html"",""Kedar Jadhav"")"	India

Mushfiqur was principally selected as an understudy to the ever-present wicketkeeper, Khaled Mashud, but his inclusion was further evidence of Bangladesh's determination to build for a better future. He had done well on an A-team tour of Zimbabwe earlier in 2005, scoring a century in the first Test at Bulawayo, and also enjoyed some success in England the previous year with the Under-19s, making 88 in the second Test at Taunton. He showed more evidence of grit with the full team, with a maiden first-class half-century to soften the pain of defeat against Sussex, followed by a career-best 115 against Northamptonshire. That earned him a call-up - as a batsman - to become the youngest player to appear in a Test match at Lord's. He was one of only three players to reach double figures in a disappointing first innings, but a twisted ankle kept him out of the second Test. After captaining Bangladesh's Under-19s to fifth place in the Youth World Cup in February 2006, he also featured in Bogra's inaugural Test, against Sri Lanka the following month, but could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara. He remained on the sidelines for the next few months but was recalled for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe at home in December.  He scored his maiden half-century at Harare in February 2007 and was picked as the first-choice wicketkeeper, ahead of Khaled Mashud, for the World Cup in the West Indies. 
 He shows sound technique in his glovework and is Bangladesh's first-choice wicketkeeper after Dhiman Ghosh's departure to the ICL. A stodgy lower-order batsman, Mushfiqur has grown into one of the better players of spin in the line-up. After a slow start to his Test career, he found form in the 2008-09 season with stubborn knocks under pressure. He has under-performed as a batsman in ODIs, but his form picked up in 2009 and he narrowly missed out on a maiden ODI hundred on the tour to Zimbabwe. In January 2010 he cracked his maiden Test century, a notable achievement as it came against a strong Indian Test side and was the fastest by a Bangladesh player. And after Bangladesh's unexpected defeat in Zimbabwe in 2011, Mushfiqur was also elevated to leadership role, taking over as captain from Shakib Al Hasan.

Bangladesh needed 44 from the last five overs of the T20 game, and Sabbir coolly struck three sixes to ensure the country's first gold in the Asian Games itself. 
 He had earlier turned heads with his big-spinning legbreaks in the Dhaka club scene as well as for the Bangladesh U19 side in the 2010 U19 World Cup, but he chose the Guangzhou International Cricket Stadium to launch himself.
 He continued to flourish in T20 cricket for the next two seasons but his lack of runs in first-class and one-day cricket held him back. Finally he was chosen to play for Bangladesh in 2014 in his favoured format, but it wasn't a great start. He made his ODI debut towards the end of the year and although not the finished article nor a proven player at this level, he was chosen in their 2015 World Cup squad.
 Born in Rajshahi, Sabbir possesses exceptional fielding skills and is a handy legspinner: he took a six-wicket haul in the 2014-15 Dhaka Premier League.

He also made his Test debut in 2018 on the back of his white-ball form but the experiment of turning him into a Test opener only lasted five matches.  
 He has twice held the record for the highest score in a T20I, his career-best 172, made against Zimbabwe in 2018, surpassing his 156 than he took off England in 2013 - an innings that included 14 sixes. In 2014, Finch was named Australia's T20I captain, replacing George Bailey, but on the eve of the 2016 T20 World Cup in India the selectors decided to consolidate the captaincy of all three formats and handed the job to Steven Smith. Finch at the time was the No.1-ranked T20I batsman in the world, but found himself suddenly struggling to hold on to his place in the side. He had been an automatic selection in Australia's ODI and T20 teams, and had set the tone for their triumphant 2015 World Cup with 135 in their opening match against England at the MCG. 
 In 2018, amid a meltdown in Australian cricket centered around the ball-tampering scandal at Newlands, Finch found himself installed as the permanent national white-ball captain and was selected to make his Test match debut against Pakistan in the UAE despite a modest first-class record. Finch made 62 and 49 on debut in Dubai but endured a form slump in the home 2018-19 season after trying to adjust his technique to Test cricket and was dropped from the Test side after five matches. 
 He had made his first-class debut for Victoria aged 21 in a tour match against India in 2007 but did not play his first Sheffield Shield match until two years later.  Victoria had not always viewed Finch in their preferred Sheffield Shield batting order, and nearly three years came between his second and third first-class centuries from 2011 to 2014. He made an unbeaten 288 against New Zealand in a first-class tour match in Blacktown in 2015-16, although that match was ultimately abandoned as the New Zealanders complained about the condition of the pitch. 
 Finch is an in-demand T20 cricketer having played for seven IPL franchises as well as Yorkshire and Surrey in England. He has also been a mainstay of the Melbourne Renegades side since the inception of the BBL and captained the Renegades to their first BBL title in 2019.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1223018.html"",""Aaron Finch"")"	Australia

He was fast-tracked into the Sri Lanka squad for the 2009 World T20 in England and played a role in Sri Lanka's progress to the final in that tournament. However, he did not play the 2010 World T20, and had largely been ignored by the national selectors until early 2017.

In the post-Jacques Kallis era, Pretorius' away swingers and lower-order runs earned his first international call-up in 2016. 
 That was eight years after Pretorius was named in South Africa's under-19 squad for the 2008 World Cup. He never got to the tournament because he tore a cartilage in his right knee. Having seen the fragility of a sportsman's career, Pretorius put it aside as an option and chose to study instead. Three years later, armed with an accounting degree, he decided to give cricket another go.
 Pretorius joined the North-West provincial side in the 2010-11 season and only got a look-in for the final game of the summer. He scored 53 and took 5 for 38, and became a regular member of the side the following season. In 2011-12, he was named the T20 Amateur Cricketer of the Year and was included in the Lions' squad for the 2012 Champions League T20, but the knee flared up again and he required surgery.
 When Pretorius returned, he stopped striving for speed and shelved the idea of bowling 140+. Instead, he operated in the mid-130s and tried to emulate Vernon Philander's accuracy. He earned a franchise contract in the 2014-15 season and was named the South African Cricketers' Association's MVP in 2015. In winter 2016, he traveled with the South Africa A squad to play a quadrangular competition in Australia and in September 2016, he was called up to South Africa's ODI squad to play Ireland. Although Pretorius was only due to play that game, he was retained for the ODI series against Australia when Wayne Parnell was injured.
 Pretorius was called up to South Africa's Test squad to Australia in November after Dale Steyn broke his shoulder, on the back of strong batting performances in South Africa's first-class competition.

That yorker, a deceptive slower ball, and an excellent bouncer formed the body of Malinga's menace, while the action made his deliveries hard to pick up. All that ability was also set off by street smarts; Malinga was rarely shy to switch up plans, and reshuffle fields. Even when batsmen thought they knew what was about to come, Malinga retained the capacity to surprise. 
 Found in his teens playing soft-ball cricket on the beaches of Rathgama, just north of Galle, Malinga became one of the poster boys for the informal Sri Lankan coaching system and its philosophy of equipping unconventional bowlers, rather than remaking them. Malinga has repeatedly credited Champaka Ramanayake for his success. It was Ramanayake who initially took interest in him, and with whom he developed the yorker that became the foundation of his career. The coach would glue a pair of shoes near the popping crease. Malinga would spend hours bowling at them. 
 Initially picked for his pace, Malinga toured Australia with the Sri Lanka team in 2004, where he claimed 6 for 90 in a tour match and went on to make his Test debut - he dismissed Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in the same over, in Darwin. During an impressive tour of New Zealand the following year, his low-slung action resulted in the New Zealand batsmen asking the umpire to change the colour of their trousers as the ball was getting lost.
 But it was in the shorter formats that destiny beckoned Malinga. He became the first - and, so far, only - bowler to claim four wickets in four balls, when he took Sri Lanka to the brink of victory against South Africa, in the 2007 World Cup. He has two more ODI hat-tricks - against Australia and Kenya - and he quickly established himself as Sri Lanka's limited-overs spearhead. Though Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan also played important roles, Malinga was arguably the single-most important player in Sri Lanka's excellent run in global tournaments from 2007-2014.
 It is felt Malinga never realised his full potential in Tests, though perhaps through no fault of his own. He was only the third player to reach 100 Test wickets for Sri Lanka but a knee injury in 2008 laid him low for two years. He was picked again for Muttiah Muralitharan's farewell series, but again found himself injured for a period of some months. In April 2011, at the age of 27, Malinga announced his Test retirement, citing the desire to manage his ""chronic knee injury"" and extend his limited-overs career. It is thought his unique bowling action places a substantial load on the joints in his hips and legs. However, the fact that he announced his retirement while playing for Mumbai Indians in the IPL rankled at home. Through the forthcoming years, Malinga would go on to have a complicated relationship with Sri Lankan fans and media. In that time, he also became one of the IPL's iconic figures, representing Mumbai throughout.
 Malinga's finest moment came during the 2014 World T20, in which he nominally captained the side through the knockouts but, more importantly, delivered a clinical final spell to muzzle the India middle order. Sri Lanka would go on to win that title but, before long, Malinga's career became threatened by fitness issues - both involuntary and self-inflicted. In late 2014, a long-standing ankle complaint deteriorated to the extent that it required surgery. Malinga was a diminished force through the 2015 World Cup and became significantly slower in his later years, in which he also put on weight. 
 He stepped down as T20 captain ahead of Sri Lanka's 2016 World T20 campaign, again owing to a chronic knee injury, this time in his left leg. He has at times suggested that his career hangs in the balance as a result of these injuries. At others he has said he wishes to play on for another few years.

Languid, easy on the eye, all shots in his armoury, Sharma emerged from Mumbai's suburbs as the heir apparent to the batting greats of the 2000s. Ironically his IPL franchise nicknamed him ""Hitman"" when he was anything but: more caresser, less hitter.  
 However, it took time and persistence for him to become the double-hundred machine and IPL-winning phenomenon that he eventually became.  
  
 That Sharma had the talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. So while it took time for that batting talent to translate into runs, the casual observers kept getting frustrated, and the trained eyes of the selectors and captains kept backing him. It had Sharma frustrated too, who began to hate the word ""talent"", which became a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - it did so spectacularly.
  
 Sharma scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won five IPLs in its first 12 editions, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series, one of them a double. Sharma became one of the colossal six-hitters of his era. So spectacular and certain was his acceleration that people began anticipate a double-century every time he went past a score of 50.
  
 Along the way, his captaincy at Mumbai Indians, whom he led to four titles, won plaudits. He was methodical, studious and calm, using all available technology and data to arrive at decisions.

His domestic exploits for Abahani in the Dhaka Premier League and Rangpur Division in the National Cricket League in the 2014-15 season earned him recognition and later a call-up in the senior side for the Test against India in Fatullah in June 2015. 
 Hailing from the northern district of Dinajpur, which is around 331km from capital Dhaka, Liton began his adolescent life as a young cricketer in BKSP. He impressed one and all with his heavy run-scoring in school and age-group cricket. He was soon picked in Bangladesh's Under-19 side in 2012, the usual route for any talented young cricketer from BKSP and soon enough, he scored heavily in Youth ODIs too. In two Under-19 World Cups in 2012 and 2014, Liton averaged 51.33 with a century and three fifties.
 A compact batsman with a good defensive technique and flair in his strokeplay, he quickly got into domestic first-class cricket in the 2011-12 season. He scored a century and a fifty in his second season but due to preparation for the 2014 Under-19 World Cup in the UAE, he played just two first-class matches in the 2013-14 season.
 In the 2014-15 season, he hit big time when he was the second highest-scorer in the Dhaka Premier League for Abahani and later the top-scorer in the first first-class tournament of the season, the NCL. He was soon called into Bangladesh's T20 squad against Pakistan in April 2015 before being handed a Test debut against India in June. He also made his ODI debut against India in the same series.Mohammad Isam"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221378.html"",""Liton Das"")"	Bangladesh
Colin de Grandhomme	Colin de Grandhomme	July 22, 1986, Harare 	34 years 221 days	New Zealand, Auckland, Jamaica Tallawahs, Kolkata Knight Riders, Manicaland, Midlands, Nagenahira Nagas, New Zealand A, Royal Challengers Bangalore, St Lucia Zouks, Warwickshire, Zimbabwe Under-19s	Allrounder	Right-hand bat	Right-arm medium-fast	74*	New Zealand v South Africa at Auckland, Mar 3, 2012	"A bruising, broad-shouldered batsman, and a disciplined medium-pace bowler, Colin de Grandhomme left Zimbabwe for Auckland in 2006, before eventually finding his way into New Zealand's representative teams. Unsurprisingly, his first international foray was in the T20 format. Having earned a reputation as a heavy hitter in New Zealand's domestic T20 competition, de Grandhomme earned a debut against his native Zimbabwe in 2012. He did not sufficiently impress to keep his place on that occasion, but continued to flourish on the domestic circuit.  
 In 2016, an unbeaten fourth-innings 144 off 147 balls, to lead Auckland's successful chase of 373, put him back into national reckoning, this time in the Test format. But it was with the ball that he left his first significant impression on international cricket; his 6 for 41 against Pakistan on a Christchurch green-top were the best figures for a New Zealand debutant, bettering a 65-year-old record. 
 From then on he was a fairly regular member of the New Zealand team in all three forms. He made his first Test century against West Indies in December 2017. He played a significant role in the 2019 World Cup, making a brilliant 47-ball 60 in a nail-biting winning chase against South Africa and 64 against Pakistan. In the extraordinary final against England, he was unplayable at times while bowling a vital spell taking 1 for 25 from 10 overs including the prized wicket of Joe Root. 
 De Grandhomme had represented Zimbabwe at the Under-19 World Cup in 2003-04, and broke into the Manicaland side in 2004-05 before ascending to Zimbabwe A and Zimbabwe Under-23s, for whom he scored a century against Eastern Province in the SAA Provincial Challenge. Soon, though, de Grandhomme felt his future lay outside Zimbabwe, and he quickly made a mark in Auckland. In 2008-09, he averaged 54.50 with the bat and 24.19 with the ball as Auckland won the State Championship.
 In June 2009 he was named in a New Zealand Emerging Players team to take part in a quadrangular tournament in Australia. His figures in the Plunket Shield in the 2009-10 season were again strong, though his domestic limited-overs form was somewhat disappointing. A steady show in 2010-11 - during which he was part of the Auckland side that won the domestic one-day tournament and wrested the Twenty20 title from Central Districts - resulted in another call-up to the New Zealand Emerging Players team in 2011. He has scored over 600 runs in a season three times, since 2011, and it was his performance over several years, as much as the rapid 144*, that earned him a Test call-up.Liam Brickhill and ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222371.html"",""Colin de Grandhomme"")"	New Zealand

What he observed, not just from his own side's lacklustre display, but the inspiration provided by Brendon McCullum's New Zealand side, convinced him an entirely new approach was necessary, with a policy of no fear (and no retribution) at its heart. It required a man of strong will not just to say it, but to implement it, but Morgan did so, seeking to fashion an England side that would play with courage and be impervious to pressure or criticism. 
 The revival he led was dramatic, culminating in England lifting the World Cup for the first time at Lord's on a nerve-shredding evening in July 2019. They went into the tournament ranked as the No. 1 ODI side, having set a host of new records, including the two highest scores made in the format. Morgan, relentlessly committed to this bold style of play on good days and bad, was at the heart of the transformation.
 Morgan's self-sufficiency and independent thought has caused him to tread a path that has not always been popular with English administrators. He preferred the IPL to county cricket long before it was ECB policy. Although he strove for a while to play for England in all three formats, he played the last of his 16 Tests in 2012 and his interest in the longer format appeared to wane once he recognised he had little chance of a recall. A somewhat private man, he is respected by his players for his inner strength, cool temperament and tactical nous but remains largely a closed book to those outside the dressing room.
 Once the selectors had decided to dispense with Alastair Cook just before Christmas in 2014, Morgan, the regular ODI deputy, was the most obvious candidate. A left-hander who quickly built a reputation for inventive and audacious strokeplay, Morgan also possessed the patience and power of shot to be a natural ""finisher"" - a role England had struggled to fill for a decade. In some ways, he was a prototype, encouraging the English game to adopt a more inventive approach only subsequently to face up to the challenge that he might be overtaken by more highly-powered models.
 As a young man in Dublin, Morgan was recognised as a cricketer of rare unorthodox talent, who plays the ball exceptionally late and was adroit both at sweeping and reverse sweeping. Time at Dulwich College only hardened his desire to play for England, which he never tried to hide back in Ireland.
 Morgan made his Ireland debut at the age of 16, making 99 against Scotland in Ayr, and was soon signed by Middlesex, who gave him his debut a week after his 19th birthday. He floundered in the 2007 World Cup: batting at No. 3, he made only 91 runs in nine games. But he soon established himself in the Middlesex line up, especially in limited-overs cricket, and his switch to England was long anticipated. After securing Ireland's qualification for the 2011 World Cup, in April 2009, he was called up by England, thereby denying Ireland the chances to pick him in the World T20 and beyond.
 At the age of 23, he shot to prominence on the back of two match-winning innings against South Africa. First was a 34-ball 67 in the Champions Trophy in September 2009, followed two months later with an unbeaten 45-ball 85 in the opening Twenty20 of England's tour of South Africa. His bold approach and crisp hitting evoked comparisons with Kevin Pietersen.
 His growing stature was confirmed when he was the only England player to be awarded a new contract at the auction for the third season of the IPL in January 2010. He was signed for $220,000 by Bangalore, where he joined England team-mate Pietersen. But he failed to make an impression and was soon left on the bench. He returned to his best for England in the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean as his powerful shot-making and coolness under pressure helped England to their first triumph in global limited-overs events. With three ODI hundreds that year, his first for England coming against Bangladesh in Dhaka, his reputation was soaring.
 Despite a modest first-class record he was rewarded with a surprise call-up to the Test side for England's first Test of the 2010 summer, against Bangladesh. Walking out to bat at 258 for 4, he could not have asked for a gentler introduction and showed enough confidence to pick up his first Test boundary with a reverse-sweep. With the retirement of Paul Collingwood, a permanent space opened up in England's Test side. Centuries against Pakistan and India represented the high points, but a disastrous tour of the UAE in early 2012 effectively ended his Test career.
 He remained an indispensable member of the one-day side, though. And while there were prolonged fallow periods - from September 2012, for example, he went a year and 17 innings without an ODI half-century and, by the time he was appointed captain, he had scored one fifty in 19 innings - he produced enough outstanding innings to retain his place. Going into the 2019 World Cup, he was England's record run-scorer in ODIs.
 While his captaincy record at domestic level was not inspiring and the 2015 World Cup campaign was painfully poor, progress was fast once England embraced a new coaching regime and bolder selections. A watershed series against New Zealand saw England, so hesitant and mediocre at the World Cup, pass 400 for the first time in ODIs and secure their highest successful chase (both records that were subsequently overtaken). A new template had been set.
 Such was Morgan's stature within the side, he survived his decision to skip the Bangladesh tour in 2016 on security grounds and oversaw a spell of 12 bilateral series wins out of 13, including nine in a row broken only by an aberrational defeat against Scotland. If highlights were a 4-1 victory in Australia in early 2018 and a 5-0 whitewash at home later in the year, it was all a prelude to the 2019 World Cup where he became the first England captain to lift a global 50-over trophy.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222849.html"",""Eoin Morgan"")"	England

He switched bases from Roorkee to Delhi to Rajasthan, then returned to Delhi, and was even thrown out of an academy once. A few years down the road, he opened the batting for India in the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh, smashed a record-breaking fifty against Nepal and followed it up with a century against Namibia to help India qualify for the semi-finals. Incidentally, his century came on the same day when he was bought by Delhi Daredevils for INR 1.9 crores from a base price of Rs 10 lakhs. A year after making his Ranji Trophy debut at the age of 18 in 2015, Pant broke records by scoring a triple-hundred against Maharashtra and a blistering 48-ball hundred against Jharkhand in the 2016-17 first-class season. In January 2017, he was rewarded with a call-up to India's T20 squad for the three home matches against England.

Born in Barbados to an English father and Bajan mother, the possibility of his inclusion in England's 2019 World Cup squad became subject of much speculation in the run-up to the tournament. Changes to the ECB's qualification rules led to him becoming eligible after three years of residency - rather than the expected seven - and he was quickly given his chance at international level. 
 Archer had declared his intention to play for England soon after moving to the country, taking advantage of his British passport. He impressed with Sussex, as well as in T20 leagues around the world, and made his debut in an ODI against Ireland. It only took a couple of performances - he picked up 2 for 29 in a T20I against Pakistan, followed by 1 for 6 from four overs of precision pace in an abandoned ODI - to convince England of his value at the World Cup, never mind concerns that his promotion might ruffle feathers among the fast-bowling group.
 Archer's talent was obvious as he set about following his friend and fellow Bajan Chris Jordan into the England set-up. It was Jordan who first alerted Sussex to Archer's talents after facing him in a net session in Barbados and his assessment that ""the sky is the limit"" has been borne out by batting and bowling spells of great promise.
 Archer, a silky fast bowler with a high action capable of speeds above 90mph, and dangerous lower-middle order batsman, played for West Indies Under-19s in 2013 but after suffering a serious back injury he slipped out of the Barbados system. Instead, he rallied while playing for Sussex's 2nd XI and for Horsham in the Sussex Premier League.
 Archer claimed four scalps on his first-class bow against Pakistan before collecting a maiden five-wicket haul in a Royal London Cup defeat to Somerset. He had been playing without a contract because of a long-term back injury, but Sussex acted quickly to secure him for longer. He made a powerful impression when he broke into Sussex's Championship side in the latter half of 2016, making his debut in all three formats and taking 35 wickets in all, 23 of them at 30 runs apiece in Division Two to bring cheer to a mundane Sussex season. He also wasted no time showing his potential with the bat as he struck 72 batting at No. 8 on debut against Essex.
 He floated into the crease with good effect in 2017, too, with 61 wickets at 25 and an average of more than 45 with the bat, a bright aspect of Sussex's flagging promotion campaign. That winter he went to the Big Bash League for the first time and subsequently showed his star potential in the IPL after being bought for £800,000 by Rajasthan Royals.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1224546.html"",""Jofra Archer"")"	England

In T20, especially, he has proven a hard man to get away, with subtle changes of pace and variations including a wrong'un and straight ball making up for a lack of prodigious turn.  
 At the 2016 World T20 in India, no Australian bowler took more wickets during the tournament than Zampa's five at 13.80 at an economy rate of 6.27. In the IPL that followed, he claimed what was the second-best figures in the tournament's history when he took 6 for 19 for Rising Pune Supergiants, albeit in a losing cause against Sunrisers Hyderabad.
 After two years in and out of Australia's ODI and T20I teams he finally became a regular in 2019 playing every game on the successful tours of India and the UAE and bedding down his place for that year's World Cup squad.
 His white-ball success has curbed his opportunities at first-class level. Zampa's father Darren played for New South Wales Country and Zampa also began his career in his home state, debuting for New South Wales in 2012-13 before moving to South Australia the following year. He return to Sydney for the 2019-2020 season in the hope of more first-class opportunity.

Shahzad has proven his worth time and again with a series of thrilling batting displays, often producing his own version of the helicopter shot, and his fearlessness at the crease makes him one of the few Associate batsmen capable of standing toe-to-toe against Full Member opposition. 
 Shahzad had yet to make his debut when Afghanistan's magic carpet ride took them from WCL Division Five in 2008 to three straight promotions up the Associate cricket ladder, but he proved to be a valuable addition to the squad at his maiden tournament, the 2009 World Cup Qualifier in South Africa. Needing a win in their final Super Eight match to secure ODI status for an initial four-year period, Shahzad struck 73 in a 21-run victory over Namibia. Afghanistan made that that cherished ODI status more permanent, with Shahzad at the forefront of the batting unit, most prominently in T20s. He has played a starring role in each of Afghanistan's World T20 Qualifier campaigns to secure four consecutive berths at the World T20, beginning in 2010, and he is far and away his country's career leading scorer in the format. 
 Due to his adventurous strokeplay and the nature of Afghanistan's membership status, Shahzad has sometimes been unfairly stereotyped as a limited-overs specialist but he has an adaptable technique to play long-form cricket too. Eleven days after his 64* off 46 balls ensured a successful chase against Ireland in the 2010 World T20 Qualifier final, Shahzad engineered one of the greatest heists in first-class history, scoring a fourth-innings 214 not out to overhaul a target of 494 in a 2010 Intercontinental Cup match against Canada. 
 The one blemish on Shahzad's ledger is linked to his weight, which has been a fluctuating concern under different management regimes. The short and stocky wicketkeeper received a major wake-up call when he was left out of Afghanistan's final 15-man squad for the 2015 World Cup on fitness grounds by then coach Andy Moles. The sting of missing Afghanistan's maiden appearance at the ICC's showpiece event in Australia and New Zealand spurred him on to a wondrous revival and at the end of 2016 he was named the ICC Associate & Affiliate Cricketer of the Year, the first Afghan to claim the honour. 
 In January 2017, Shahzad achieved a rare feat of scoring two T20I half-centuries in a day, leading Afghanistan to victories over Oman and Ireland in the morning semi-final and evening final of the inaugural Desert T20 Challenge in Dubai. It would later emerge that in a drug test taken just days earlier, Shahzad tested positive for the banned substance Clenbuterol, which Shahzad claimed to have inadvertently ingested through his use of the weight-loss supplement Hydroxycut. After a provisional suspension started in April 2017, he was retroactively suspended for one year and became eligible to play again on January 17, 2018.

Eventually persuaded by his piles of runs for Northcote, the Victorian selectors gave him a run of games in the Sheffield Shield side during 2013-14 and Stoinis rewarded them with an outstanding 170 against Tasmania, a breakthrough innings that led to him becoming a regular in the top order. Stoinis was Victoria's leading run-scorer in the 2014-15 Sheffield Shield season and was called into Australia's squad for their limited-overs matches against England in 2015, where he debuted, playing an ODI and a T20I.  
 He did not do enough to secure a permanent place in the national squad then, but continued to impress in first-class cricket and scored a century for Australia A against South Africa A in 2016. He was selected for his second ODI in January 2017 and what an ODI comeback it was: after claiming three wickets, Stoinis scored 146 not out from No. 7 to help Australia almost pull off an unlikely victory against New Zealand at Eden Park. That innings gave Stoinis a permanent place in the ODI and T20I teams where he has since batted in a multitude of spots in the middle order and bowled in a variety of roles including the death overs. He was Australia's ODI cricketer of the year in 2018-19. 
 His first-class cricket stalled in the same period with a long dip in form, in part due to a lack of continuity. He also had to move from Victoria back to Western Australia for family reasons. Talked about as a potential Test match allrounder, despite a middling first-class record, he was called into an extended Test squad for the second Test against Sri Lanka in February 2019.

Little more than 6ft tall, with a smooth and athletic run-up, his fast arm surprises batsmen and he has a natural full-of-a-length delivery, swinging the ball both ways at pace. A reasonable tailender and with excellent hands in the outfield, Hassan - softly spoken yet fiercely ambitious - represents the talent which exists in Afghanistan. 
 The match at Lord's was a significant step for a bowler whose family fled the bombs of Jalalabad when he was six, and who subsequently learned the game in Peshawar where thousands of his countrymen sought refuge. His family, all of whom hated the game, did their best to encourage education but Hassan's determination - he played the game in secret for years - eventually won them over. He was first spotted when playing for Afghanistan in March 2006 in Mumbai when they defeated an MCC side led by Mike Gatting, where the then MCC president, Robin Marlar, noticed his potential, and was stunned to see him bowling in flat trainers. Hasan toured England with the national side in 2006, playing several matches against county second XIs, winning them all and was drafted onto MCC's groundstaff where he bowled against his hero, Andrew Flintoff, and was quick enough to smash Monty Panesar's helmet in the nets.
 He ventured north to play for Norden CC in the Central Lancashire League the following year and represented Afghanistan in the 2009 World Cup Qualifiers, where his whippy action on a corrugated pitch earned him his first five-wicket haul, helping his side upset the tournament favourites Ireland. His once apathetic family celebrated back home by sacrificing a lamb and handing it around the small village to poor people.
 Although Afghanistan missed out on World Cup qualification, they earned ODI status and at their next qualifying event - for the World Twenty20 - Hassan's incisive death bowling and 12 wickets played an important part in their qualification for the tournament in the West Indies. It appears the only thing that might be able to limit Hassan's ambition is the frailty of his own body. In 2012 a knee injury necessitated two operations, and he missed out on the World T20 qualifying final against Ireland in 2013. When he's fit, he completes Afghanistan's varied bowling attack, and his pace, reverse swing and yorkers make him Associate cricket's most lethal bowler.Liam Brickhill"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221779.html"",""Hamid Hassan"")"	Afghanistan

That debut, in Mohali in 2012-13, came to Dhawan in his ninth year of first-class cricket after he had been written off by almost everybody, not least because India's opening combination had been fixed to the most prolific combination in their Test history: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. 
  Dhawan is one in a long line of stroke-players from Delhi, which became the Indian batting capital in the 2000s. He stands upright in his stance, is a bit stiff with his hands when he pushes forward, and is partial to the cover-drive. Those who played domestic cricket with him say he is supremely confident, bordering on showmanship. He is also a flamboyant personality with his ever-changing looks and the twirled moustache.
  However, the attractive strokes, which were apparent even in the 2003-04 Under-19 World Cup where he was the Player of the Tournament for scoring 505 runs at 84.16 with three centuries, didn't seem to translate into huge seasons in Ranji Trophy. His average stayed steady in the mid-40s, but he didn't quite dare the selectors to overlook him. After lukewarm showing in the IPL and five ODIs, and with the Test openers going well, it seemed Dhawan would be left consigned to domestic cricket and T20 leagues.
  Fortune turned, though, and both Sehwag and Gambhir lost form dramatically, giving Dhawan a chance at the age of 27 with 81 caps and 5679 first-class runs to his name already. Dhawan grabbed the chance with arguably the best debut by an Indian batsman, smashing 187 off 174 balls to set up India's win in a Test that was reduced to four days.

Mashrafe Mortaza	Mashrafe Bin Mortaza	October 5, 1983, Norail, Jessore 	37 years 146 days	Bangladesh, Asia XI, Dhaka Gladiators, Dhaka Platoon, Khulna Division, Kolkata Knight Riders	Bowler	Right-hand bat	Right-arm fast-medium	51*	Bangladesh v Zimbabwe at Chattogram, Nov 23, 2001	"The quintessential country boy, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza epitomised the term ""bursting onto the scene"". He first came into attention during an under-17 regional tournament in 2001 when he bowled fast, slammed sixes and dived around without a care in the world. 
 Mashrafe's entry also sparked plenty of enthusiasm because he was the first genuine fast bowler to emerge from Bangladesh since their entry into Test cricket in 2000. He was sent to a camp conducted by West Indian great Andy Roberts, who proclaimed that Mashrafe had a great future. The selectors fast-tracked his growth and within a few months, during which he played four games for Bangladesh A in India, the young man from far-off Narail took the new-ball against visiting Zimbabwe. Soon it was clear that he had what it takes: Mashrafe was making the likes of Grant Flower jump around due to his pace, a first for a Bangladeshi fast bowler.
 But another thing was also clear to those who observed him - his rickety bowling action. Feet and arms landed in the wrong arcs, and soon the injuries set in. And that has been the story of his career. Mashrafe has missed more games for Bangladesh than he has played ever since his 2001 debut. He has had seven operations on his legs, knees and ankles, which have taking a beating - first due to poor handling by captains who gave him long and ill-adviced bowling spells, and then due to freakish accidents.
 After many missed games in between the odd fiery spell, Mashrafe rose to prominence in 2004, when he helped Bangladesh beat India for the first time. He was ever-present when Bangladesh pushed Australia but dropped the crucial catch of Ricky Ponting that cost the home side a win. But he made up the following year when his four-wicket haul destroyed India in the 2007 World Cup game at Port-of-Spain. Mashrafe's early strikes have always helped Bangladesh, none more so than in the 2009 tri-series final when he and Nazmul Hossain sunk Sri Lanka to a new low - six runs for five wickets. Bangladesh lost the game but Mashrafe was tremendous in his ten overs.
 He was made captain in mid-2009 but in his first Test in charge, fell over and injured his knee. When he returned the next year, he led Bangladesh to a win against England in the summer of 2010 before falling over once again in his home debut as captain, against New Zealand. He missed the 2011 World Cup after yet another knee injury, but has since made a successful return in the 2012 Asia Cup.Mohammad Isam"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221382.html"",""Mashrafe Mortaza"")"	Bangladesh

Only he chose to do it with one of the most inimitable masters of the game. To try to imitate is one thing, to pull it off at Test level, to imbibe it so much that it becomes you, is quite another. Brian Lara's cousin and Dwayne Bravo's half-brother, the younger Bravo, used to watch cricket only for Lara. As soon as Lara would get out, Bravo would switch off the TV and go out to bat. The result was not quite The Prince, but a talented left-hand batsman with the same walk, the same backlift, the same flourish, the same footwork, the same mannerisms. The most incredible part, though, is that none of it seems forced, gratuitous or less than the best that Bravo can do. The man was born to bat this way, right down to the same Lara leap upon reaching a century. It was that century that eluded Bravo for his first 31 ODIs, nine Tests and four T20Is. The appetite, though, was there. For a stylish and attacking batsman, he is one of the few young stars in world cricket who feel more at home as the length of the format increases. His early century drought might suggest otherwise, but he is a man for long innings, a man who seems to love to bat on and on. His first century arrived in Bangladesh, in his tenth Test, and he made it a big one, falling five short of a double. He scored two more in the series in India immediately after. After 12 Tests his run aggregate and average were identical to that of Lara's after 12. He scored his first ODI century against Zimbabwe in 2013. Of course Bravo doesn't have to face the quality of bowling Lara did, and he bats a position lower that Lara's No. 3. Like Lara he will soon become the best batsman of a struggling batting line-up. What he does with a team even weaker than the one Lara played in will be Bravo's real test.

Chris Woakes	Christopher Roger Woakes	March 2, 1989, Birmingham, Warwickshire 	31 years 363 days	England, Delhi Capitals, England Development Programme Under-19s, England Lions, England Performance Programme, England Performance Programme XI, England Under-19s, Herefordshire, Herefordshire, Kolkata Knight Riders, Marylebone Cricket Club, Nottinghamshire 2nd XI, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Sydney Thunder, Warwickshire, Warwickshire 2nd XI, Wellington	Allrounder	Right-hand bat	Right-arm fast-medium	95*	Australia v England at Sydney, Jan 23, 2011	"By the time Chris Woakes returned from England's tour to South Africa at the start of 2016, he feared his Test career was over. He was 27 by then and had played six Tests. But, despite bowling respectably on almost every outing, he had never quite made the breakthrough and an average of 63.75 made dispiriting reading. It looked as if he may be remembered as one of England's nearly men. 
 But fate offered another chance. A knee injury to Ben Stokes saw Woakes recalled to the squad to play Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street. On the same day he claimed career-best figures of 9 for 36 against Durham - ""It was like facing 90mph leg-breaks,"" Paul Collingwood said - and, with Alastair Cook insisting Woakes' batting gave him the edge (both Paul Farbrace and Trevor Bayliss wanted Jake Ball to play), he made it back into the XI.
 It was to prove the start of a golden summer. After career-bests (up to that point) with bat and ball at Chester-le-Street, he made a maiden Test half-century at Lord's and followed it with an unbeaten 95 to help England to an unlikely tie in an ODI at Trent Bridge. It was the highest score by a No. 8 or lower in the history of ODIs and helped England recover from 92 for 6 in pursuit of 287.
 Then, at Lord's, he claimed 11 for 102 against Pakistan, becoming the first England bowler since Ian Botham in 1978 to take a five-wicket haul in each innings of a Test at the ground. He followed it with another seven wickets and a half-century in Manchester and five more wickets in Birmingham. His 26 wickets at 16.73 apiece were a record in a series between England and Pakistan. Woakes, finally, had arrived at the top level. He was named one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for his efforts.
 In many ways it was a surprise it had taken so long. Woakes had long been a highly respected player at county level. He made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in 2006 as a 17-year-old and, before he was 20, was topping the county's bowling averages (45 wickets at 20.48 in 2008) with impressive control and an ability to swing the ball both ways. Most of all, though, he impressed with an apparently unflappable temperament that Ashley Giles, director of cricket at Warwickshire, admitted he would like ""to clone"" as the template for all players.
 After two more solid county seasons, he was selected on the England Lions tour of the West Indies in 2010, where he performed admirably and was deemed ready for the next step. He made his international debut in a T20 in Adelaide in January 2011 and kept his cool to hit the winning runs in a thrilling one-wicket victory. A few weeks later, he claimed 6 for 45 at Brisbane - the second-best figures by an Englishman in ODIs. 
 Back in the UK, Woakes enjoyed another superb summer in first-class cricket with 56 wickets at 21.78 and 579 runs at 48.25. Most of his chances for England came with the white ball, playing spasmodically over the next couple of years, before being handed a Test debut at the end of the 2013 Ashes. He performed respectably on a flat pitch, but it was felt he lacked the pace to prosper at Test level and he was left out of the Ashes squad for the return tour to Australia. 
 Having worked hard to add that pace, Woakes was recalled in place of Stokes in the summer of 2014 and played three Test in succession against India. He enjoyed no luck, but demonstrated the skill and control to suggest he had a future at that level. But a succession of injuries - and the development of Stokes - saw him slip back among the chasing pack and he lost his central contract at the end of 2015.
 The summer of 2016 changed his fortunes, and his growing reputation was rewarded in 2017 by a first IPL contract. But having been expected to lead England's attack in the Champions Trophy, he instead pulled up after bowling just two overs in their opening match and missed the rest of the tournament. A difficult Ashes tour followed and he was dropped from the Test side in New Zealand - his bowling average away from home having risen to 61.77 - but he bounced back during the English summer, scoring a maiden Test century, against India at Lord's.George Dobell"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1223522.html"",""Chris Woakes"")"	England

To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them. 
  This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.  
  Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs. He was a genuine threat to Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI and 51 Test hundreds. 
  An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection. 
  Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him."

Born in Khost, Zadran made his List A debut in Islamabad in 2011, when Afghanistan became the first international team to visit Pakistan since the 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team, and his speed and wicket-taking ability soon saw him installed as a regular fixture in their playing XI. 
 Zadran was clocked at 145.3kph during the Asia Cup in 2014, and provides the sort of pace rarely seen in Associate sides. He was Afghanistan's spearhead at their successful World T20 qualifying campaign in 2011-12, and represented the team at both the 2012 and 2014 tournaments. While he probably won't stick around for long at the crease, Zadran is also a handy sting in the tail of Afghanistan's batting. He cracked four sixes in seven deliveries to help Afghanistan to a last-over win against Zimbabwe in 2014 - a result that allowed Afghanistan to claw their way back into, and eventually level, the series.Liam Brickhill"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221776.html"",""Dawlat Zadran"")"	Afghanistan

A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt. 
 However, his prolific form earned him a contract in the PSL with the Lahore Qalandars. He showed flashes of the class he'd been displaying domestically, particularly during a 33-ball 56 against Karachi where he destroyed the opposition bowling and looked extremely elegant while doing so. It earned him a call-up to Pakistan's T20I side for the West Indies tour, and he made his debut in the second match in Port of Spain.
 His first three T20Is only brought him 26 runs, and much of the world was still unaware of his talent when he made his ODI debut a couple of months later, in England, during the 2017 Champions Trophy. Having missed the opening-match defeat to India, Zaman turned Pakistan's batting fortunes around with scores of 31, 50, 57 and 114 in his first four ODI innings, his strike rate of 113.00 giving a dated 50-overs line-up much-needed oomph at the top of the order. The maiden hundred went on to win him the Player-of-the-Match award in the final, setting up a total of 338 that proved a long way beyond India's reach.Danyal Rasool"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221113.html"",""Fakhar Zaman"")"	Pakistan
Ravindra Jadeja	Ravindrasinh Anirudhsinh Jadeja	December 6, 1988, Navagam-Khed, Saurashtra 	32 years 84 days	India, Chennai Super Kings, Gujarat Lions, India A, India B, India Blue, India Emerging Players, India Red, India Under-19s, Indian Board President's XI, Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Rajasthan Royals, Rest of India, Saurashtra, Saurashtra Cricket Association XI, West Zone	Allrounder	Left-hand bat	Slow left-arm orthodox	87	Sri Lanka v India at Colombo (RPS), Feb 8, 2009	"""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."" A fellow Gujarati, Mahatma Gandhi, could well have meant to say this about Ravindra Jadeja. The best of observers ignored his left-arm spin at first, then he was ridiculed for his three triple-centuries in Ranji Trophy, the idea of Jadeja the Test player was contested when India handed him a debut in 2012-13 against conventional wisdom, but Jadeja won them all over with over after over of unerring accuracy, and sits among the elite of Indian spin bowling now.  
 In October 2019, Jadeja became the quickest left-arm bowler to reach 200 Test wickets. In August 2013, he became the first Indian since Anil Kumble - in 1996 - to top the ICC ODI bowling rankings. In the IPL, Jadeja drew a scarcely believable bid of US$2 million in 2012. A few years ago, Shane Warne had nicknamed him ""Rockstar"" because of his confidence in his own ability and flamboyant ways. His most valuable skill, though, didn't have the glamour of a rockstar: fitness and strength to be able to be at the batsmen for hours, ready to pounce on any assistance from the pitch.
 In an era that Jadeja was bound to be overshadowed by the artistry of fellow spinner R Ashwin, he actually kept the senior spinner on his toes and often stole the spot when conditions allowed India to play just one spinner. It helped that he was a captain's dream: arguably the fastest man on the turf and the best fielder in the time that he played, he went on to become an important lower-order batsman, a far cry from the subject of memes that his batting at the start of his career was. The ridicule of his triples - more than any Indian had ever hit in first-class cricket - was actually an indictment of the quality of bowling in Indian domestic cricket at that time. 
 Even after he had established himself, Jadeja had to fight through a serious shoulder injury and was even dropped from the squad, but he kept coming back. These hardships paled in comparison with the tough childhood in Jamnagar and the early knocks in his cricketing career, including being banned by the IPL for a year for essentially trying to negotiate his salary in the IPL.Sidharth Monga"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1220591.html"",""Ravindra Jadeja"")"	India

Instead, he became the first Pakistan captain since the great Imran Khan to win a 50-over world title.  
 Sarfraz took over the ODI reins in February 2017, providing his side with rare single-minded direction and focus. In June that year, Pakistan went into the Champions Trophy as the lowest-ranked team and lost heavily against India to start off, but then went on a red-hot run to beat South Africa, Sri Lanka and hosts England, and finally India to claim the prize. 
 A right-hand middle-order batsman, Sarfraz wasn't always the sprightly presence that bossed the Sharjah Test of 2014 - when Pakistan chased 302 in 57.3 overs to level the series. In fact, between 2007 - when he made his debut - and 2014, Sarfraz had played just four Tests, four T20Is and 26 ODIs. He was miles off being a regular in any of Pakistan's sides, and not nearly good enough to warrant a place as a specialist batsman; he hadn't scored an international half-century in all this time. It was an era when the Akmals - no less than three of them - had taken out a lease on the area behind the stumps. 
 Sarfraz had appeared on Pakistan's radar initially by leading Pakistan's Under-19s to the World Cup title in 2006, scoring half-centuries in his third and fourth match. He broke into domestic cricket, where 523 runs in 10 matches along with 28 dismissals behind the stumps pushed him into the A team's tour of Australia in 2007. Then he was left in the wilderness. 
 It took seven long years for the spotlight to return to Sarfraz, when he made 74 in Pakistan's total of 359 in the second innings against Sri Lanka in Dubai. The innings was in a losing cause, but it did establish him as the team's first-choice wicketkeeper. He averaged 71.20 over the next 18 months, and during this period also elbowed his way into the ODI side midway through the 2015 World Cup campaign with a run-a-ball 49 against South Africa. 
 Since then, Sarfraz has been a man for all formats, steady with the gloves, aggressive with the bat and street-smart as a captain across formats. At 30, with the Champions Trophy tucked under his arm, he became arguably Pakistan's most respected cricketer since Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan. It would remain that way till October 2019, when a sustained loss of personal form saw him abruptly removed as captain in all three formats and dropped from the side entirely.

The accolade everybody anticipated became his three years later, when Alastair Cook stood down after the 2016-17 tour of India. It was understandable that there were a few fears for Root's future workload. He was rare among England batsmen in achieving maturity so quickly, and had looked consumed by the delights of batting from the moment he first took guard. Now he had new responsibilities.  
 Slight of build, perky of shot and with a scampish grin that got under a bowler's skin, by the time Root was appointed Test captain he had rattled up 53 Tests within five years with an average top side of 50, comfortably the highest among contemporary England players. Early expectations that he would establish himself as an opener did not materialise as an expansive game increasingly seemed better suited to No. 3 or No. 4. He was equally influential in limited-overs cricket where England's commitment to fearless cricket after their 2015 World Cup was much to his tastes, his crispness of stroke and shrewd judgment enabling him to bat purposefully around batsmen of greater weight of shot.
 Root had never been a strikingly heavy scorer as he worked through the ranks, nor was he particularly athletic, but his systematic approach was that of a young batsman who would not sell his wicket easily and gave England hope that he would be able to attune his game to the highest level. A slender batsman reliant on precision, his patience and stubbornness at the crease had Geoffrey Boycott gushing that he reminded him of himself, although Root soon developed a much broader range. Others saw some of his mentor Michael Vaughan in Root's front-foot drive - the pair also both attended Sheffield Collegiate.
 Root's Test debut for England in Nagpur in 2012 exemplified the qualities which had attracted coaches from an early age. Picked to tour India on the strength of two encouraging seasons with Yorkshire - and having been named Cricket Writers' Club Young Player of the Year - he impressed enough to be selected for the final Test of the series. He began with England's sixth-longest debut innings in terms of balls faced, scoring 73 from 229 balls as he displayed the patience and discrimination demanded both by the situation of the game and a desperately slow surface. 
 His rise continued with a maiden Test hundred in his home ground, Headingley, against New Zealand in 2013 followed by a maiden Ashes century at Lord's having been promoted to open. Root looked set to occupy that role for many years to come, but his fortunes dipped as the series went on and then crashed along with the team as England were whitewashed in Australia in 2013-14. He began the tour at No. 6, moved up to No. 3 after the enforced departure of Jonathan Trott, then saw his Ashes ended early when he was dropped for the fifth Test in Sydney.
 Proof of Root's ability came in the way he responded. Back in England, he followed up a two-tone double hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's - a disciplined innings with a freewheeling finale - with two more big hundreds against India. All three had the not-out asterisk. That seemed to say a lot about him.
 He even had the fortune to skipper Yorkshire to the Championship title at Trent Bridge in 2014 when Andrew Gale was suspended, less than a fortnight after he became the first Yorkshire batsman to hit an ODI hundred at Headingley, with India the victims. He was also in charge for Yorkshire's thumping defeat at Middlesex, in which they chased down 472 in the fourth innings. To his amusement, his team-mates dubbed him ""Craptain"". 
 His full potential then poured forth in 2015 when he made 1385 Test runs in the year, and vied with Australia's Steven Smith at the top of the ICC Test rankings. Root played with alacrity on all surfaces and in all formats and his obvious delight in his art was a positive symbol in an England side committed in all formats to a more enterprising approach. Jaunty Ashes hundreds at Cardiff and Nottingham helped England to victories, his consistency at No. 4 repeatedly masked top-order frailties, and a mischievous sense of humour made his success all the more pleasurable.
 As England fell to defeat against Pakistan in the UAE in late 2015, a pattern began to build up which piqued Root even as he confirmed himself as one of the best batsmen around: his world became rather too full of entertaining 70s and 80s when he felt that a big hundred was there for the taking. Between his hundred in Johannesburg in early 2016 on a triumphant England tour and a century in Rajkot as England slumped 4-0 to India, he passed 50 six times but only converted one into a hundred. There again, it was quite a hundred: a career-best 254 against Pakistan at Old Trafford that banished talk of premature burnout in a non-stop England programme.
 Firmly established among the modern game's ""Big Four"" batsmen (Root, Smith, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson), these were years of easy scoring. In 2015 and 2016 he set consecutive records for runs accumulated across all formats in a calendar year for England, with 2228 and 2570 respectively; in 2017, he came within five runs of surpassing Vaughan's calendar high-water mark of 1481 for England in Tests, which had stood since 2002. The following summer, with back-to-back efforts against India, Root surpassed Marcus Trescothick's English record of 12 ODI hundreds.
 Problems of conversion returned to afflict him in his second year as Test captain, however. Having made a matchwinning 190 against South Africa at Lord's, in his first match in charge, and a century in England's first day-night Test, against West Indies at Edgbaston, he went more than a year before again reaching three figures in a Test. That period included another unsuccessful Ashes tour of Australia, where Root topped the England averages but could only manage a highest score of 83. Defeat in New Zealand followed, then a messy draw at home to Pakistan, before England rallied to beat No. 1 side India 4-1 and give Root encouragement in his plans to rebuild the Test side.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222868.html"",""Joe Root"")"	England

That both titles came in the T20 format defines the kind of cricketer he is. A batsman who hits the ball hard enough to make the inanimate thing scream for mercy, he functions primarily as a finisher. He generates even more pace with the ball in hand and when it is anywhere near him in the field, it doesn't matter at what pace it's travelling. Russell will probably get to it. He is less a cricketer, in the traditional sense, than an athlete.  
 An allrounder from Jamaica, Russell made his first-class debut at the age of 19. He made his way into the West Indies A squad and captured plenty of attention with his exploits in a 50-over game against Ireland in June 2010, smashing 61 off 34 balls and taking 6 for 42. It was a performance that helped him win a place in West Indies' 2011 World Cup squad. Things didn't go to plan there, but his capabilities were on show against the newly-crowned champions India in June when he came out at No. 9, with the score at 96 for 7, and smashed 92 off 64 balls. 
 Russell's impact in international cricket was a bit sporadic until 2015, against South Africa in Port Elizabeth, when he provided a consolation victory for West Indies on a difficult tour by hitting 64 off 40 balls to chase down 263 with one wicket to spare. ""My thing,"" is how he described batting in the slog overs. ""I think I really enjoy when there's five overs or ten overs left."" 
 Those skills were evident in domestic T20 cricket though. He had a fine season with Worcestershire at the Friends Life t20 in England in July 2013 and a ground-breaking Caribbean Premier League a month later when his team Jamaica Tallawahs became champions. Russell's star shone brightest at the IPL 2015, when he was named Man of the Series, and the Big Bash League 2015-16 when he struck at 186.86 and picked up 16 wickets - joint-second best - from 10 matches. He won the CPL title with Tallawahs in 2013, the IPL title with Kolkata Knight Riders in 2014, the Bangladesh Premier League title with Comilla Victorians, the BBL title with Sydney Thunder and the Pakistan Super League title with Islamabad United in 2016. 
 His flamboyant style is a part of his personality as well, which became apparent as he unveiled a hairstyle similar to Mr T at the 2015 World Cup. A year later, with his mohawk dyed blonde, Russell applied the final touches to a mauling of hosts India in the World T20 semi-final as West Indies became the first team to win the trophy twice.
 During the most successful period of his T20 career, however, a cloud hung over Russell because the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission had charged him for not filing his whereabouts clause three times in 2015, an offence tantamount to one failed dope test. After hearings that went on over a year, Russell was found guilty of a whereabouts-clause violation and banned for one year by an independent doping panel in Jamaica. The ban was from January 31, 2017, until January 30, 2018.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1232420.html"",""Andre Russell"")"	West Indies

For an upcoming left-handed opening batsman, especially in the modern game, that's a fairly smart pick. 
 Lewis moved up the ranks playing age-group cricket for Trinidad & Tobago, and was part of a championship winning Under-19 side in 2008. His List A debut came in October 2009, when he struck a half-century playing for West Indies U-19s. The following January he was representing them at the World Cup.  
 Like Gayle, Lewis' best has come in the T20 circuit. In 2013, he was Trinidad & Tobago's top-scorer in the Champions League with a strike-rate of 141.61. He showed big-match credentials, striking 62 off 46 balls in the semi-final against a Mumbai Indians attack comprising Mitchell Johnson and Harbhajan Singh. The following year, at the Caribbean Premier League, he made 321 runs from eight innings, the most by a T&T Red Steel batsman and only 42 behind Gayle, who had played 11 innings. 
 By this time, Lewis began to attract overseas interest. He hit 101 not out off 65 balls in his first stint at the Bangladesh Premier League, which paved the way for his first West Indies call-up, for a World T20 no less. Lendl Simmons had been injured for the early part of the 2016 tournament, which helped Lewis' ""dream"" come true. Ironically, his maiden T20, List A and first-class centuries came after the T&T board took away his domestic contract.

But the country has struggled to unearth quality batting prospects at the same rate as their bowling unit. The emergence of the hard-hitting Hazratullah Zazai is a sign that this may change early in the country's Full Member era. 
 A tall, hulking presence at the crease, Zazai made waves as a 20-year-old by striking back-to-back half-centuries in just his second and third matches to ensure a T20I series sweep of Ireland. In the final match at Bready, he single-handedly outscored Ireland with his 82 off 54 balls, which included seven sixes.
 If that wasn't enough to grab headlines, then hitting six sixes in an over less than two months later did the trick while batting for Kabul Zwanan against Balkh Legends in the inaugural season of the Afghanistan Premier League in Sharjah. Having already bashed a 44-ball ton earlier in the tournament, Zazai's intimidation factor grew exponentially when he became the sixth batsman in competitive cricket, and third in T20s, to achieve the six sixes feat after carving up left-arm spinner Abdullah Mazari to put his name alongside Yuvraj Singh and Garry Sobers, among others, in the record books. Hidden in the euphoria of the six sixes was the fact that Zazai matched Yuvraj and Chris Gayle for the fastest fifty in all T20 cricket off 12 balls. 
 In February 2019, he belted an unbeaten 162 off 62 balls against Ireland in just his fifth T20I which included a record 16 sixes, one of many benchmarks set on the day both for himself and Afghanistan in a world record T20 total of 278. Time will tell if Zazai can make a similar impact in ODI and Test cricket for Afghanistan.Peter Della Penna"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1185621.html?alt=1"",""Hazratullah Zazai"")"	Afghanistan

 Fernando was making hundreds for his school's first XI before he was 14-years-old, and went on to become one of the school system's most prolific batsmen, hitting more than 1000 runs in the 2015 season. He was eventually picked for Sri Lanka's age-group teams, and made a hundred in his second Youth ODI innings, hitting 127 from 103 balls against visiting Australia Under 19s, in 2014.
 It was after his bumper school season that Fernando really blossomed at the Under-19 level. He hit 95 from 96 balls in Sri Lanka's victory over England in the quarter-final of the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, and later in the year would hit two consecutive hundreds against the same opposition, this time in a bilateral series in England.

Jonny Bairstow	Jonathan Marc Bairstow	September 26, 1989, Bradford, Yorkshire 	31 years 155 days	England, England Lions, England Performance Programme, England Performance Programme XI, Kerala Kings, Melbourne Stars, Peshawar Zalmi, St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Team Moeen, Team Stokes, Yorkshire, Yorkshire 2nd XI	Wicketkeeper batsman	Right-hand bat	Right-arm medium	141*	England v India at Cardiff, Sep 16, 2011	"Jonny Bairstow, the son of the former England wicketkeeper David Bairstow, is a combative wicketkeeper-batsman who has become a cricketer to be reckoned with in England's middle order. The journey was far from easy for Bairstow, especially with Jos Buttler in contention for the gloves, but prolific run-making for Yorkshire eventually made a case that England's selectors could not ignore. Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed. 
 Bairstow's wicketkeeping has rarely met with universal approval and, much to his chagrin, the debate as occasional chances have been spurned about whether he might be better playing as a specialist batsman has never been silenced. But from the moment that he delivered an emotional maiden Test century in Cape Town, where his father has strong off-season links, and the aggressive batting that Yorkshire prized so highly has become a regular feature of the England scene, with only regular appearances in T20 eluding him.
 He has had to fight against a tendency to play across the line and, to that end, he stands tall, bat held aloft, adding to his pugnacious image. Driven and independently minded, he is very much his own man. Intensive work with Bruce French, England's wicketkeeping coach, has also made his keeping more secure.
 He was a talented all-round sportsman at an early age, even having trials with Leeds United as a right back. But it was cricket which soon dominated. An early starter with Yorkshire's Under-15s, he was named Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year in 2007, having already played for Yorkshire's Second XI and their Academy side and represented England Under-17. In October 2008, he followed in his father's footsteps by signing a full-time contract with Yorkshire.  He was eight-years-old when his father took his own life. Merely to play the game, and for the same county was courageous enough.
 He made an impressive first-class debut against Somerset in June 2009, cracking 82 in his second innings and soon secured his place in the first XI and further honours followed when he was picked up by England's Performance Programme and included in the England Lions successful tour of the Caribbean in January 2011.
 By now Yorkshire's first-choice keeper, he registered his maiden first-class hundred against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May of that year. Having previously passed fifty 17 times in 34 first-class matches without reaching three figures, just to emphasise his breakthrough, he made it a double. During his brilliant attacking innings, he was joined by England's recently retired opening bowler Ryan Sidebottom, in a record ninth wicket partnership for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire (which had stood since 1899) of 151. Bairstow and Sidebottom were sons of two of Yorkshire's best-loved former players, David Bairstow and Arnie Sidebottom. The passing of talent between the generations could not have been more satisfactorily captured.
 Many suspected that, long term, Bairstow would become a specialist batsman and his debut innings in one-day internationals backed up that theory as he hit an unbeaten 41 off 21 balls against India at Cardiff before a tough tour of India showed the realities of international cricket. However, further development followed with a match-winning T20 innings against Pakistan in the UAE and after a strong start to the 2012 season he was handed a call-up to the Test squad to face West Indies.
 It was not a happy series for Bairstow, whose problems against some hostile short bowling from Kemar Roach gained much media attention, and after a modest return of 38 runs at 12.66 he was left out of the opening Test of the South Africa series as England went with Ravi Bopara. Confirmation that he had slipped back in the selectors' thinking came when Bopara withdrew from the second Test for personal reasons and James Taylor was preferred.
 But after Kevin Pietersen was dropped in extraordinary circumstances for the third Test at Lord's, another opportunity arose for Bairstow to which he responded magnificently. Confidence bolstered by a century for England Lions against Australia A, he led an England fightback from 54 for 4 in their first innings on day two with a brilliant 95, emerging from a peppering with short deliveries to play some fluent attacking shots in an innings former England captain Michael Vaughan said would have been the finest maiden Test century he had witnessed had his fellow Yorkshireman not been bowled by Morne Morkel.
 His increasing international involvement restricted his appearances for Yorkshire, although he did find time to hit 182 - his second biggest first-class score - to set up a crushing win over Leicestershire at Scarborough in the Championship and a match-winning 68 not out against Sussex in the semi-finals of the FLt20.
 Bairstow retained his place for England's winter schedule, beginning with the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. He was unable to make a significant contribution and his participation in the India Test series was also limited before he was granted leave to return home because of a family illness, missing the subsequent ODI series.
 Thereafter his bit-part status congealed - he lost his spot in the T20 team following the New Zealand tour and, after returning to the Test team during the Ashes as England dropped Nick Compton and moved Joe Root up the order, he was abruptly left out at The Oval. He spent much of the summer running 12th man errands at a crucial stage in his development. A squad member for the return tour of Australia, he played in the last two Tests, replacing the out-of-form Matt Prior, but did not unearth the performances to promote his worth as Prior's long-term successor and had to buckle down to the county circuit the following summer.
 That 2015 season promised to be the making of him as he struck 1108 first-class runs at 92.33, allowed by Yorkshire to play as he saw fit. Nothing was more emphatic than his 366-run alliance with Tim Bresnan at Chester-le-Street, both players making carer-bests, Yorkshire's fifth highest stand of all time. England were receptive. A combative 83 not out at Chester-le-Street after a late summons settled a weather-hit ODI against New Zealand in England's favour and the faltering form of Buttler brought a Test recall against Australia.
 It was Cape Town, though, where Bairstow really broke through, as the summer of 2016 testified. Bairstow's second Test ton was reserved for his home crowd against Sri Lanka: 140, batting at No. 7, out of 298. On a challenging surface, he played with a certainty not given to others. England's top order was repeatedly found wanting in Test cricket, but the belligerence of Bairstow and co down the order constantly dug them out of a hole, and another hundred at Lord's followed.
 His desire was relentless and his growing impact in ODIs was enough for him to replace the out-of-form Jason Roy at the top of the order in the Champions Trophy semi-final - a defeat against Pakistan in Cardiff. The West Indies felt his frustration at that at the end of the summer in the form of his first two ODI hundreds.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1224399.html"",""Jonny Bairstow"")"	England

Imam ul Haq answered that question emphatically right at the get-go, stopping conspiracy theorists and cynics who cried nepotism - his uncle is chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq - with a glorious start to his international career. A hundred against Sri Lanka on debut made him the second player from Pakistan to reach three figures in his first match. He followed that up with a splendid outing in Zimbabwe, where he scored three centuries and became the first player in ODI history to score four hundreds in his first nine matches. 
 A bespectacled, slight young man with a deferential, curious note running through his voice, Imam is a ruthless accumulator at the crease. A left-handed opening batsman descended from arguably Pakistan's greatest batsman of all time, Imam is particularly strong on the drive and off his hips. He looks to have faith in his abilities even in high-pressure moments, though he is admittedly yet to be tested in truly demanding conditions or the highest quality of opposition; he was unwittingly done a favour when he was benched for most of Pakistan's disastrous ODI tour of New Zealand at the start of 2018.
 His start to Test cricket hasn't quite been as eye-catching, though an unbeaten 74 in the fourth innings of his debut match prevented Pakistan from falling to an astonishing defeat against the debuting Test nation Ireland. In the two Tests that followed in English conditions, he appeared susceptible to the moving ball - Stuart Broad dismissed him in all three innings, twice by trapping him lbw. He has the technique and level head to be able to succeed in red-ball cricket, and upcoming home tours of Australia and New Zealand provide him the perfect opportunity to make his mark as a long-term opener in both longer formats.Danyal Rasool"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221168.html"",""Imam-ul-Haq"")"	Pakistan

With a bouncing, high-kneed approach to the crease and a bagful of variations, his initial value to Afghanistan was as an enterprising legspinner but his batting has become increasingly useful. He pays precious little regard to the textbook, but Shenwari's good eye means that when he hacks violently at the ball, more often than not he connects and he's crept up from Afghanistan's lower order into their middle. He's also a capable fielder, and is often stationed at point. Shenwari helped to engineer Afghanistan's historic win over Bangladesh at the Asia Cup in March 2014, sharing in a 164-run stand with Asghar Stanikzai and then picking up the vital wicket of Mominul Haque. He has been part of all of Afghanistan's World T20 campaigns, and was shortlisted for the prize of ICC Associate and Affiliate player of the year in 2014.

Born in Pakistan, Khawaja moved with his family to Australia when he was a young boy, and in the 2011 Sydney Ashes Test became the first Muslim to play for Australia. Batting at No.3 in place of the injured Ricky Ponting, he made 37 and 21 and showed impressive poise, giving Australia a ray of hope in a series that had brought them little but doom and gloom. A classy left-hander in the languid style of David Gower, Khawaja won further Test opportunities from 2011 to 2013 but never quite kicked on beyond his regularly appealing starts. Dropped during the 2013 Ashes, he earned another recall in 2015 for the home series against New Zealand following the retirements of Michael Clarke and Chris Rogers.  
 A move from New South Wales to Queensland in 2012 helped to reinvigorate his career; he declared his enjoyment of the game had ebbed away in Sydney. A serious knee injury suffered in late 2014 put him out of action for six months, but when he returned to captain Australia A on the 2015 tour of India he impressed Rod Marsh's selection panel, and further leadership opportunities came when he was named captain of Queensland for the 2015-16 season. In the same season he proved himself as a quality T20 player by dominating the BBL with four superb innings, including two unbeaten centuries, to guide Sydney Thunder to the title. He also established himself in the Test team in 2015-16 and played consistently well in matches at home but struggled away, particularly in Asia where lost his place in the side on tours of Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh. 
 But Khawaja's subcontinent demons were finally slayed in the UAE in 2018 when he made an epic match-saving century against Pakistan in Dubai. He became Australia's most senior batsman while Steve Smith and David Warner were banned following the ball-tampering scandal and settled himself in the ODI team with two outstanding tours of India and the UAE in 2019, making his first two ODI centuries to ensure selection in the 2019 World Cup squad.

 Born in the Bay of Plenty region in New Zealand's North Island, Boult is, in the words of his brother Jono, a ""normal sort of Kiwi young guy… into his golf and fishing and surfing."" Cricket, though, was his calling. He lived in a neighbourhood which included eventual New Zealand team-mates Kane Williamson and Doug Bracewell, and had the backing of a supportive household that also kept him grounded. Signs of his skill were evident even as a teenager. As a 17-year-old, he was named the fastest secondary school bowler in the country. A year later, he was representing New Zealand at the Under-19 World Cup.
 The transition to senior cricket, though, was not quite seamless. Boult suffered a stress fracture of the back in 2009 which put him out of cricket for two years and taught him to concentrate on strength and conditioning. There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark. He became one of New Zealand's irreplaceable players across formats and one of many protagonists in the side's march to their first World Cup final in 2015. 
 Boult had a tough time breaking into the limited-overs sides at first, due to a perception that he doesn't move the white ball as much as the red one. But his effectiveness in Test cricket was too compelling to ignore: he raced past 100 wickets in his 29th match and in 2013, only two years since his debut, he was New Zealand's top-wicket taker. With Brendon McCullum placing a high premium on attacking cricket in the shorter versions as well and Boult proving himself as a bowler who preferred getting batsmen out rather than keeping them quiet, it was a perfect fit. Confirmation came in World Cup 2015 when he ended up the joint-leading wicket taker with 22 scalps in nine matches including 5 for 27 in an epic victory over Australia. His worth in T20 cricket was emphasised by a (approximately) $600,000 payday in the IPL.
 Boult's strength, according to Northern Districts coach John Pamment, is that, ""he's got a lovely wrist position and the fact that the wrist goes right behind the ball gives him that control."" Another asset for Boult is friend and sounding board Tim Southee. When on song, their partnership makes for compelling viewing, not to mention telling numbers. In 2014, the pair picked up nearly half the wickets New Zealand took - 67 of 143 - en route to the side's most successful Test year, with five wins in nine matches. 
 The pair have both raced past 200 Test wickets and by 2019 occupy third and fourth on New Zealand's all-time Test wicket-taking list behind Hadlee and Daniel Vettori. Boult was again magnificent in the 2019 World Cup helping lead New Zealand's attack taking 17 wickets. He took a hat-trick against Australia, and the key wicket of Virat Kohli in the semi-final win over India. He bowled the last over and the Super Over in the tied final against England and without some misfortune he may have won the World Cup for his nation. 
 Boult is also among the few fast bowlers who are exceptional fielders, and has a particular knack for one-handed blinders.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222471.html"",""Trent Boult"")"	New Zealand

Particularly strong off the pads, and with a fondness for driving on the up, Shankar made scores of 111, 82, 91, 103 in the Ranji Trophy knockouts to finish with 577 runs at 57.70 that season, after returning from a groin injury. 
 He was subsequently rewarded with an India A call up and made an unbeaten half-century on debut against an Australia A attack comprising Gurinder Sandhu, Andrew Fekete, Sean Abbott, and  Steve O'Keefe. Shankar also impressed against South Africa A and aimed to become a genuine allrounder, instead of a batsman who can bowl part-time.
 As a teenager Shankar had honed his skills on his terrace, which doubled up as a make-shift indoor net, with his father and brother Ajay, who played lower-division cricket in Tamil Nadu. Shankar bowled offspin until he was 20, but switched to medium-pace in a bid to break into a spin-heavy Tamil Nadu side.
 At 21, he was handed his first-class debut against Vidarbha in Nagpur, where he scored 63 not out and took two wickets. He had to play understudy to a settled middle order, before his breakthrough season in 2014-15.

Kusal Perera	Mathurage Don Kusal Janith Perera	August 17, 1990, Kalubowila 	30 years 195 days	Sri Lanka, Colts Cricket Club, Comilla Warriors, Cumilla Warriors, Kandy Tuskers, Rajasthan Royals, Ruhuna, Schools Invitation XI, Southern Express, Sri Lanka A, Sri Lanka Under-19s, Wayamba	Wicketkeeper batsman	Left-hand bat		135	Australia v Sri Lanka at Adelaide, Jan 13, 2013	"Possessed of a short backlift, powerful forearms and relentless bloody-mindedness, left-handed batsman Kusal Janith Perera's batting is not just inspired by his hero Sanath Jayasuriya's technique, at times, it seems an exact duplicate.  
 Like Jayasuriya, he has a second skill - though it is wicketkeeping rather than slow left-arm, and he was part of Sri Lanka's Under-19 teams, before he joined Colts Cricket Club as a senior. At Colts, Perera quickly set about forging a career founded on aggression and reliability in equal parts, and after two seasons, Sri Lanka's selectors could no longer ignore him. 
 An injury to Kumar Sangakkara saw him earn a place in Sri Lanka's limited-overs squad to Australia in January 2012, where his breezy innings made plain his talent - particularly during a 22 not out at the Gabba that took Sri Lanka home in a low-scoring ODI.  Though a middle-order batsman by reputation, he was promoted to the position of opener in the two Twenty20s that followed, where he continued to play impactful innings
 On return to Sri Lanka, Perera hit a first-class double-ton, then a 275-ball 336, and had proved enough to the selectors to be given a central contract and an extended run in the limited-overs sides.
 Perera hit his maiden ODI century in Mirpur in 2014 to help Sri Lanka complete a 3-0 whitewash over Bangladesh. He then hammered a 17-ball half-century, Sri Lanka's joint-fastest, against Pakistan in Pallekele in July 2015, to equal Jayasuriya's record.
 A month later Perera was handed his Test debut against India in Colombo. He made twin fifties, becoming only the second Sri Lanka batsman to score two half-centuries on debut.
 Perera's burgeoning career hit a stumbling block in December 2015 when he was provisionally suspended from international cricket by the ICC, after having failed a dope test. He was recalled from Sri Lanka's tour of New Zealand and subsequently missed a bilateral T20 series in India, Asia Cup, and World T20.
 His plight appeared bleak when his initial sample tested positive for the performance-enhancing drug, 19-Norandrostenedione, but it grew bleaker when his B sample returned identical results.
 Perera had strong support from SLC, though, and also spent a substantial amount of his own money in fighting the WADA-approved lab's findings. His campaign to be cleared included a trip to England for a polygraph test, a hair analysis and a separate urine test, as well as substantial coordination with his main legal team, which was based in the UK. 
 All this eventually paid off when his name was cleared in May 2016, bringing his suspension to an end after five months out - the Qatar-based lab's findings were deemed ""unsustainable"" for ""scientific and technical reasons"" by an independent expert hired by the ICC.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1099826.html?alt=1"",""Kusal Perera"")"	Sri Lanka
Mark Wood	Mark Andrew Wood	January 11, 1990, Ashington, Northumberland 	31 years 48 days	England, England XI, Chennai Super Kings, Durham, Durham 2nd XI, Durham Academy, England Lions, Northumberland, Northumberland Under-13s, Northumberland Under-15s, Northumberland Under-17s	Bowler	Right-hand bat	Right-arm fast	13	Ireland v England at Dublin (Malahide), May 8, 2015	"It looked, for a while, as if Mark Wood would be another of those fast bowlers who promised more than they delivered. 
 An apparently relentless succession of injuries - particularly injuries to his ankle - threatened to either end his career or turn him into another fast medium seamer who compromised his pace for a longer career in the game.
 But Wood was not to be denied. Abandoning a short run-up that was a characteristic of his career up until the latter part of 2018, Wood instead reasoned a longer approach to the crease would put less pressure on his body and allow him to hit the speeds his early career had promised.
 The results were dramatic. Returning to the England team for the final Test of the Caribbean tour in early 2019, Wood claimed a maiden five-wicket haul and generated speeds of around 95 mph in a remarkably hostile demonstration of fast bowling. Scyld Berry, the veteran Telegraph correspondent and a man believed to have seen more England Tests than anyone else, rated it the quickest spell he had ever seen by an England bowler.
 There was more to come. Recalled to the ODI side just before the World Cup, he went on to play a huge role in the team's eventual success. With Jofra Archer he traded records for the quickest deliveries of the tournament - both exceeded 95 mph - and, by offering pace and wicket-taking potential in the middle-overs, ensured his captain always had a potent weapon in the field. While Archer finished with more wickets (21 to Wood's 18), Wood finished with the better strike-rate. 
 Underlining his commitment to the cause, Wood sustained a serious sides strain during the final but, with the match in the balance, continued to bowl at high pace. He was subsequently ruled out of the Ashes series that followed.
 Wood never did fit the prototype of a modern England fast bowler. He is skinny, barely 6ft tall and, originally at least, bowled from a sprinter's run-up but after his speed caught the eye with Durham and the Lions, he was given a Test debut at the start of the 2015 summer. He made an instant impression against New Zealand, bowling above 90mph and celebrating wickets with abandon, kept his place for the visit of Australia and capped things off by taking the wicket that sealed England's Ashes victory at Trent Bridge. In no time at all, the imaginary horse that had ridden around the county grounds of England to stave off boredom had become a recognisable part of his England celebration. Here was a fast bowler of unsuppressed vitality.
 Like Stephen Harmison, Wood hails from Ashington in Northumberland and played for the same club. The former England quick also encouraged him to go to Australia at 18 to improve his game - not bad advice from a man who suffered bouts of homesickness away from the Northumberland coast. Where Harmison stands 6ft 4in tall, Wood is a level 6ft and delivers a whippier, skiddier ball. In his first five first-class appearances, he took 19 wickets at 21.63, including a match-winning 5 for 78 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in August 2012.
 Paul Collingwood's appetite for promoting and encouraging Durham's younger crop of players worked in his favour in 2013. He had a breakthrough summer, claiming 27 first-class wickets at 24.07 to help Durham to the Championship title and confirm his status as the latest in an impressive collection of homegrown pace bowlers. That strong showing was enough to win recognition on the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka, though it lasted only one match before he returned home with a side injury. His 2014 season was further disrupted by the first appearance of a long-running ankle problem but he was again involved with the Lions at the start of 2015 before being called up to the Test squad for the Caribbean.
 He did not get a run against West Indies but was capped in the washed-out ODI against Ireland, picking up his first England wicket, and then replaced Chris Jordan in the Test side for a Lord's debut. Wood thought he had taken the wicket of Martin Guptill in his third over, only for replays to show he had overstepped, but he eventually finished with 4 for 140 as England won a thriller. Further limited-overs involvement followed but England were already aware Wood's workload would need careful managing - he played the first two Ashes Tests but missed out at Edgbaston. James Anderson's side strain allowed him to return at Trent Bridge and he took one of the two wickets not claimed by Stuart Broad as Australia were dismissed for 60. Two days later, the imaginary horse got an outing after Wood took the wicket that secured the return of the urn.
 He made a blistering comeback from injury in the second half of 2016, delivering some of the most potent fast-bowling spells of the season as he helped Durham's to the final of the NatWest T20 Blast and also featured in England's 4-1 victory over Pakistan in their one-day international series. But further ankle issues ruled him out of a tour to Bangladesh and he missed India, too, after it was discovered that he bowled at the tail end of the English domestic season when his ankle was fractured. It all meant that he faced a third ankle operation within a year and, however optimistic the prognosis, cast doubts upon the resilience of a player who had won a reputation as England's fastest bowler. His comeback in 2017 was then afflicted by heel problems which limited him to five early-season Championship matches, somewhat down on pace, and saw him lose his England central contract at the end of the season.
 Lost England contract or not, England could not resist his potential. He sandwiched a disastrous debut in the IPL (conceding 49 in four overs for Chennai Super Kinds and never seen again) in between Tests in Christchurch and against Pakistan at Lord's, where his average pace  of 87mph restated his threat, but his ODI displays were unpredictable and he admitted in Sri Lanka that he was running out of opportunities to claim his place for the 2019 World Cup.
 Wood played minor counties cricket for Northumberland from 2008 to 2010 before making his first-class debut for Durham against Durham MCCU in April 2011. He made his List A debut against Northamptonshire in Clydesdale Bank 40 the following month and his first County Championship appearance against Nottinghamshire in August of the same year.ESPNcricinfo staff

But a lack of respect, for opposition bowlers at least, has served Gayle well since then. Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers. And in this era of Twenty20 cricket, Gayle is the batsman who has thrived like no other. 
 Among his many strengths, perhaps the biggest one is his outstanding hand-eye coordination, which allows Gayle to regularly hit even good-length deliveries for boundaries. Technique and footwork aren't his greatest assets, but most often he compensates with other skills. No batsman has taken to the 20-over format like he has. He showed early signs of his liking for that format by smashing the first century in Twenty20 internationals - a 57-ball 117 against South Africa in the World Twenty20 in 2007 - and when Twenty20 leagues mushroomed the world over and sought international stars, Gayle was the biggest beneficiary. 
 Over two seasons - 2011 and 2012 - of the IPL, he became easily the most feared batsman of the league, smashing more hundreds and sixes than any other batsman, by far. When he carted Pune Warriors all over the ground to score an unbeaten 175 in IPL 2013, it felt right that he should finally own the record for highest individual score, fastest century, and most sixes in a Twenty20 innings, because no batsman has dominated Twenty20 cricket like he has. 
 Gayle's free-stroking, aggressive style is obviously best suited for limited-overs cricket, but that doesn't mean he hasn't cut it as a Test batsman. When he has turned up for West Indies, his pugnacious approach has become an attacking weapon in its own right, in what's been a lean era for West Indian cricket. His 79-ball century at Cape Town in January 2004, on the back of a South African first innings of 532, was typical of his no-holds-barred approach. However, Gayle has also shown the ability to bat long periods and the hunger to make big scores. In 2009 against Australia, Gayle batted almost seven-and-a-half hours in scoring an unbeaten 165 to save the Test in Adelaide; in the very next game, though, he smashed the fifth-fastest Test century - off 70 balls - to indicate that quick-scoring remained his preferred method. Next year he batted almost ten hours and scored 333 against Sri Lanka and Muralitharan in Galle, becoming only the fourth batsman to score two triples in Tests, thus proving again his ability to bat long periods.
 And then there is also his brisk non-turning offspin, with which he has turned himself into a genuine allrounder in limited-overs cricket. His tendency to stay aloof on the field sometimes suggests he isn't interested in the proceedings, but his relaxed approached was good for the team whenever he led West Indies. However, West Indies have missed his services far too often due his differences with their board. During his exile, he was a Twenty20 regular in various leagues around the world, entertaining crowds in Australia, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. After a long spell out from international cricket he returned strongly in 2012 on the tour of England and subsequently at home against New Zealand.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1232572.html"",""Chris Gayle"")"	West Indies
Faf du Plessis	Francois du Plessis	July 13, 1984, Pretoria 	36 years 230 days	South Africa, Chennai Super Kings, Edmonton Royals, Kent, Lancashire, Lancashire 2nd XI, Melbourne Renegades, Nicky Oppenheimer XI, North Eastern Transvaal, Northerns, Nottinghamshire 2nd XI, Paarl Rocks, Peshawar Zalmi, Quetta Gladiators, Rising Pune Supergiants, South Africa A, South Africa Academy, South Africa Under-19s, South Africa XI, St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, Titans, World-XI	Middle-order batsman	Right-hand bat	Legbreak	185	South Africa v India at Cape Town, Jan 18, 2011	"Classy, composed and a fine crafter of innings', Faf du Plessis emerged as one of South Africa's most consistent batsmen in the post-Jacques Kallis era. Du Plessis is strong on the front foot, has impeccable defences and enjoys spending time at the crease. A natural leader, du Plessis was put in charge of the T20 side in February 2013 and formed part of the senior core in other formats.  
 All that may have been lost when, in 2007, du Plessis signed a Kolpak deal with Lancashire. Unlike his high-school contemporary, AB de Villiers, du Plessis did not manage to fast-track himself into the international spotlight and looked abroad for other opportunities. Apart from learning the rigours of the county system, du Plessis made a name for his fielding.
 He returned to South Africa to play domestic cricket every summer and topped the MTN40 run charts in the 2010-11 season. His Kolpak deal had expired by then and he was selected in South Africa's one-day squad for the home series against India in January 2011. A half-century on debut sealed his spot for the World Cup that followed. At that point, du Plessis was known as an aggressive ball-striker and quick run-scorer.
 He was part of the South Africa Test squad that took the Test mace off England in mid-2012, but did not play a game, instead getting a T20 debut on that tour. He got his Test chance on South Africa's tour to Australia later that year and followed his first-innings 78 in the second Test in Adelaide with a stonewalling effort for the ages in the second innings. Du Plessis spent more than seven-and-a-half hours at the crease, faced 376 balls and remained unbeaten on 110 to take South Africa to an unlikely draw, which set them up for a series win in Perth.
 His curve continued upwards when in December that year, du Plessis was given the T20 captaincy in a series against New Zealand, despite only having played four T20Is prior to that. He was then given the role permanently the following February. Du Plessis had established himself as a complete batsmen, who had the ability to shift gears and anchor an innings, and played a similar knock against India in December 2013. His 134 in the second innings of the Johannesburg Test took South Africa within eight runs of completing the highest successful Test chase, 458, and in the end secured a draw. When Kallis retired after the next match, du Plessis was an automatic choice for promotion to No.3. 
 It took du Plessis a little longer to repeat those feats in limited-overs. In his 51st ODI, he finally scored his first century in the format, against Australia in a triangular series in Harare in August 2014, but then the floodgates opened. Two more hundreds came in that series, which South Africa won. 
 Du Plessis took good form into the 2015 World Cup, after becoming the second South African to score a T20I century after Richard Levi, in February that year. He was among those left devastated by South Africa's semi-final loss. 
 While du Plessis continued to rack up runs in ODIs, he was criticised for occasionally scoring too slowly. He started to struggle in the longest format and after managing just one fifty in 12 innings in the 2015-16 season, he was dropped for the final Test against England in January 2016. 
 Du Plessis led South Africa in two World T20 campaigns, in 2014 and 2016, and despite them returning empty-handed from both, he confirmed his desire to keep the captaincy. "	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1100150.html?alt=1"",""Faf du Plessis"")"	South Africa

 Shamsi bounced between the Highveld and Kwa-Zulu Natal and pushed for a place at franchise level after a strong 2013-14 season for Easterns. He took 47 wickets at 20.02 to finish third in the three-day cup wicket-takers' list, and then played five matches in the 2014-15 franchise 20-over competition where caught the eye of the touring West Indians, who were visiting South Africa that summer. 
 In 2015, Shamsi was bought by Caribbean Premier League franchise St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, where Eric Simons was coach. There, Shamsi rose to some prominence, taking 11 wickets at 13.27 in the seven matches he played.
 More regular opportunities in franchise cricket came the next season and Shamsi took them. He finished as the leading spinner in South Africa's first-class competition in the 2015-16 summer, in which he took 41 wickets at 19.97 in Titans' title-run. In 2016, he was picked up by the IPL's Royal Challengers Bangalore as a replacement player for the injured Samuel Badree which meant that Shamsi had played in two T20 leagues before picked for the national side. 
 His ODI debut finally came in a triangular series in the Caribbean in June 2016. That same year he made his Test debut against Australia in Adelaide and the following June, he played his first T20 international. But Shamsi struggled to find a regular place in the South African side, with Keshav Maharaj established as the Test spinner and Imran Tahir their white-ball specialist. Shamsi was part of the 2019 World Cup squad and played two matches but it was only after Tahir's ODI retirement after the 2019 World Cup that Shamsi came into his own. 
 In the 2019-20 summer, he finished second on the Mzansi Super League wicket-charts and was a star performer in the Paarl Rocks' tournament-winning campaign and was afforded a regular run in white-ball series against England and Australia. In addition to his ability to take wickets, he also demonstrated the capacity to hold an end, something South Africa have always wanted from their spinners."

A couple of weeks later, Blundell was called-up to the ODI squad for the Chappell-Hadlee series at home against Australia. 
 He was part of the New Zealand U-19 World Cup squad in 2010 alongside Tom Latham, James Neesham, and Doug Bracewell. He made his first-class and List A debuts for Wellington in 2013. After an inconsistent first three seasons in domestic cricket, Blundell had a breakthrough season in 2015-16 in which he made 1073 runs in 28 matches across all formats.

In the mid-2000s, he was just what New Zealand need in the wake of the mass of departures from their batting line-up: an aggressive top-order batsman capable of taking up the challenge to world-class attacks. In only his third ODI, Taylor hammered a superb 128 against Sri Lanka at Napier in 2006 and he followed it up with 84 at better than a run a ball in his first ODI outside New Zealand, at Hobart against Australia in January 2007. He scores heavily from the pull and from slog-sweeping the spinners (and sometimes the quicks). 
 Given New Zealand's lack of Tests it wasn't until the 2007-08 tour of South Africa that Taylor made his debut and he struggled against the extra bounce. Back at home he was dropped against Bangladesh, but returned in style against England with his maiden century, 120, at Hamilton and then followed that with a memorable 154 at Old Trafford. A leadership role wasn't too far away and he was named captain for the tri-series in Sri Lanka in 2010 after Vettori and McCullum opted out.
 However, Taylor's two-year captaincy stint ended in controversy when it emerged that he and Mike Hesson, the coach who took over from John Wright, didn't have a comfortable relationship. During Taylor's 13-Test captaincy stint New Zealand notched up rare wins in Australia and Sri Lanka, but immediately after the Sri Lanka tour he stepped down in controversial circumstances, as Brendon McCullum was named captain in all formats. After deciding not to tour South Africa, he returned for New Zealand's home series against England, admitting that his relationship with Hesson was still a ""work in progress"".
 While taking time accept the decision, Taylor quickly reasserted his importance to the middle order and produced a prolific run of form in 2013 with 495 runs in five innings in a three-match Test series against West Indies. In one-day cricket he formed what McCullum would often call 'the best three-four punch in world cricket' alongside Williamson as New Zealand built towards the home World Cup of 2015. A year before the tournament he scored three ODI hundreds in three innings against India and Pakistan. He was consistent rather than prolific at the World Cup, but afterwards scored three hundreds in five innings against England and Zimbabwe.
 Back in Test cricket, a career-best 290 came against Australia at the WACA in late 2015 and in 2019 added a third double century to his tally with 200 against Bangladesh.
 Although the body started to cause some issues, he remain key to the one-day side as they began the next four-year cycle when Williamson took over the captaincy from McCullum. One of his finest innings came against England, in Dunedin, in 2018 when he was batting on one leg due to injury and scored an unbeaten 181 to a big chase. At the 2019 World Cup he was key to New Zealand's impressive semi-final victory over India with a fine half-century in tricky conditions.Brydon Coverdale and ESPNcricinfo staff "	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222465.html"",""Ross Taylor"")"	New Zealand

He has risen quickly since earning wide acclaim with an acrobatic save in the 2009 World Twenty20, and in February 2013, became Sri Lanka's youngest ever Test captain at 25, after having been groomed for the post for two years.  
 In limited overs cricket, Mathews' all-round skills are almost indispensable. When he pulled a quad in the World Cup semi-final in 2011, he forced three changes to the XI that played in the final, as the team strove for the balance he single-handedly delivers. He began his international career with ambitions of becoming a genuine allrounder, but has since given primacy to his batting, and effectively plays as a specialist batsman in the Test side. 
 Often coming to the crease at No. 6, Mathews provides solidity to the lower-middle order, which had been a weakness for Sri Lanka prior to his arrival. In ODIs he has provided two unforgettable finishes - against Australia in 2010, and Pakistan in 2012 - stealing victory with a sublime, sustained assaults, but his best work has come in the Test format. In an outstanding 2014, in which he scored 1160 runs at an average of 77.33, Mathews' finest moment was the rousing 160 at Headingley, which transformed that match and saw Sri Lanka win their first Test series in England (not including the one-off Test in 1998). 
 Mathews' appointment to the captaincy has heralded a renewed focus on youth and development by the Sri Lanka selectors. Once a successful leader of the St. Joseph's College side and the Sri Lanka Under-19 team, Mathews has been charged with ushering in a new age of Sri Lankan cricket.Andrew Fidel Fernando"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1223475.html"",""Angelo Mathews"")"	Sri Lanka
Shaheen Shah Afridi	Shaheen Shah Afridi	April 6, 2000, Khyber Agency 	20 years 328 days	Pakistan, Baluchistan, Dhaka Dynamites, Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Hampshire, Khan Research Labs, Lahore Qalandars, Northern (Pakistan), Pakhtoons, Pakistan Under-19s	Bowler	Left-hand bat	Left-arm fast	19*	Afghanistan v Pakistan at Abu Dhabi, Sep 21, 2018	"A baby face perched on a two-metre body, Shaheen Afridi's story is trademark Pakistani. An 18-year old already comfortable in the green shirt of the national side, he's been on the radar of the national selectors for almost three years. In a more intimate circle, he was destined for great achievements well before his teenage years, with an international cricketer for an elder brother. 
 Riaz Afridi made his solitary Test performance for Pakistan in 2004, when Shaheen was just four years old. He pushed Shaheen to hard-ball cricket following years of the younger brother enjoying success in Pakistan's informal tape-ball circuit. In 2015, FATA selected him after an U-16 talent hunt programme. His pace, physique and fitness won him an U-16 tour of Australia, and since then, he's been progressing through the youth squads. 
 He burst into the nation's consciousness with 8 for 39 on Quaid-e-Azam Trophy debut, the best-ever figures by a debutant in the competition. Later, he was picked for the PSL, where figures of five wickets for four runs in a group game for Lahore Qalandars won him a place in the T20I squad against the West Indies. 
 He became the first cricketer born after the turn of the millennium to represent Pakistan when he played the third T20I against the West Indies. He was later handed an ODI debut in the Asia Cup, where he replaced Mohammad Amir in the side. In December, he became the 35th player to make his Test debut for Pakistan under the age of 19.
 There is more to him than just his story, however compelling that may be in its own right. He stands at an imposing 6ft 6in, though a sweet, child-like smile and a harmless demeanour perhaps takes some of the aura away. He has the intelligence to take advantage of his height to extract bounce on the docile pitches of the UAE, while a mean yorker has proved especially difficult for batsmen to deal with. Most impressively, he can hit a good length time and again, and appears to have the temperament for a long career at this level. 
 There have been flattering comparisons already, with Pakistan boasting a rich tradition of left-arm fast bowling. In truth, he really is nothing like Wasim Akram or Mohammad Amir, both of whom were shorter bowlers who relied more on swing than bounce.

Having made his international debut in 2012, Munro was in and out of the limited-overs teams, until he hit a tournament-topping 366 runs at a strike rate of 175 in the 2015-16 Georgie Pie Super Smash. That run of form earned him a steady T20 place in New Zealand's top order.  
  He quickly justified his place. His 14-ball half-century against Sri Lanka at Eden Park was the fastest by a New Zealand batsman in T20s. More quick runs against Pakistan in the following series saw him assume the No. 3 spot in New Zealand's 2016 World T20 campaign.
  Munro made his first-class debut in 2006, but didn't really make a big impact in the longer form of the game till the 2011-12 season, when he scored a century and three fifties for Auckland. Next season he did even better, scoring three centuries in six innings, including a whirlwind unbeaten 269 off 252 balls against Wellington. He was rewarded with a call-up to the New Zealand squad for the tour to South Africa, and played in three Twenty20 internationals at the start of that tour. He made his Test debut soon after, in the second Test at Port Elizabeth.

He is predominantly a top-order batsman but his seam bowling has been termed as more than useful by many coaches in the country's age group and domestic scene. 
 Born in Sathikra, Soumya was admitted to the BKSP in Savar, the country's biggest sports institute. He quickly joined the cricket team and was part of BKSP's league campaigns from 2008-09 season. He played one game in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup, and two years later was an integral member of the side in Australia. In between, he struck a double-hundred in a one-day game against Qatar in Kuala Lumpur. At the 2012 Under-19 World Cup, he ruffled the feathers by Mankading Jimmy Peirson.
 The left-hand batsman, however, has a bit of glamour to his batting, even at a young age. He stands up tall and takes a long stride to spinners and uses his hand-eye coordination quite well against the quicks. His medium-pace has given him a lot of attention too, particularly his ability to use the new ball despite the lack of pace.
 In November 2013, he was called up to the Bangladesh Twenty20 squad but he didn't play the one-off game against New Zealand. He continued to be monitored, and when Chandika Hathurusingha, Bangladesh's new coach who took charge in May 2014, had a look at him, Soumya was back in contention.
 He was handed an ODI debut against Zimbabwe in December 2014; he didn't bowl but made 20 off 18 balls. Mohammad Isam "	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221594.html"",""Soumya Sarkar"")"	Bangladesh
Kane Williamson	Kane Stuart Williamson	August 8, 1990, Tauranga 	30 years 204 days	New Zealand, Barbados Tridents, Edmonton Royals, Gloucestershire, Gloucestershire 2nd XI, New Zealand A, New Zealand Cricket XI, New Zealand Emerging Players, New Zealand Under-19s, New Zealand Under-19s, New Zealand XI, Northern Districts, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Yorkshire	Top-order batsman	Right-hand bat	Right-arm offbreak	148	India v New Zealand at Dambulla, Aug 10, 2010	"By the time Kane Williamson is finished with playing cricket, it is probable that he will be New Zealand's greatest batsman. Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. But he may also finish as one of the game's most loved global figures. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010. 
 Williamson was born into a sporting family in Tauranga, the largest city in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty region. His father had played Under-17 cricket for Northern Districts, his mother was a representative basketball player, and his sisters played volleyball at age-group level. Williamson took to cricket and it grew beyond a hobby quite quickly. He was modest about his skills, too, - ""Everyone is gifted, I guess, but you get some that seem exceptionally so. I'm not one of them,"" - yet Williamson was billed to make it since he was 14. He scored a century on Test debut at the age of 20, and at 24 years and 151 days he was the youngest New Zealand batsman to 3000 Test runs- younger than Don Bradman too. At the crease, Williamson is comfortable against pace and spin, and he trusts the coaching manual explicitly despite the mutation of batting in the Twenty20 era. Among his best performances is his maiden Test double-century in January 2015, which helped New Zealand come from behind and beat Sri Lanka in Wellington. The innings was a testament to Williamson's hunger for runs and batting time - he was dissatisfied despite making 242 in over 10 hours.
 Williamson has made his orthodoxy work and is capable of scoring at a brisk tempo - he has a T20 hundred for Northern Knights and became the quickest New Zealand batsman, and fifth overall, to 3000 ODI runs. For a measure of his consistency, he has two streaks of five or more successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs in 20 months since 2014. He is rarely drawn to emotion and is a genial, but hard, competitor - Williamson once struck the winning six in a roller-coaster, one-wicket win over Australia in the 2015 World Cup, and celebrated with a smile and the calmest of fist pumps as Eden Park exploded in raucous jubilation.  Williamson is also an outstanding catcher and a part-time offspinner, though he needed to remodel his bowling after being banned from bowling in international cricket in June 2014 for an illegal action.
 With the mental strength to match his skills, Williamson was an automatic choice to take over the captaincy at the World T20 in 2016, soon after the retirement of the inspirational Brendon McCullum. Williamson led the team to four back-to-back victories in India, and was highly praised for his tactics that helped the team adapt to slow, turning pitches, before they were beaten by England in the semi-final.
 In 2018, Williamson led New Zealand to two famous Test series wins. In April, he became the fourth New Zealand captain to win a series against England. In December, he was the chief architect of New Zealand's first away Test series win over Pakistan in 49 years, with 89 and 139 in the final Test. He became the first New Zealander to score 20 Test centuries in 2019 with an unbeaten double century against Bangladesh at home. 
 But he elevated himself into the global pantheon of greats at the 2019 World Cup, where he was not only named player of the tournament but he carried himself with unprecedented class as the trophy was snatched from New Zealand's hands by England in the greatest final of all time. He made two match-winning centuries against South Africa and West Indies and a vital 67 in a famous semi-final win against India to get New Zealand to a second successive World Cup final. His captaincy and calmness among the mayhem of a tied final and tied Super Over was extraordinary. His conduct in the aftermath having lost the Cup on a one-off tie-break provision where the team with the most boundaries wins, was even more incredible.Alagappan Muthu"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222450.html"",""Kane Williamson"")"	New Zealand

 ""We identified Hetmyer as captain because we liked the way he went about it in the field,"" West Indies Under-19 coach Graeme West had said before the World Cup. ""He did things a little differently, he was very positive. In terms of passion and enthusiasm, you can't fault him.""
 Hetmyer scored 158 runs in six games in that competition, including successive fifties in the quarter-final and semi-final. It was his second Under-19 World Cup - he had also featured in the 2014 edition of the tournament in the United Arab Emirates.
 Hetmyer was picked up by CPL franchise Guyana Amazon Warriors for the 2016 edition of the tournament.

 A year after finishing as the fourth-highest run-scorer at the U-19 World Cup in early 2014, Pooran was involved in a serious car accident which left him with a torn patella tendon, fractured tibia and fractured ankle. After a long recovery process, he was handy a substantial contract for Barbados Tridents in the 2016 CPL on Kieron Pollard's recommendation. Unsure whether his body would continue to hold up, Pooran looked to maximise his earnings by playing in every franchise league he could including the BPL, the PSL, the Hong Kong Blitz, the T10 and for West Indies B in the Global T20 Canada. His first BPL deal, in 2016-17, earned him a ban from the WICB, who were displeased at his decision not to play regional cricket instead.
 His international breakthrough came in late 2018, when he hit his first half-century for West Indies off just 24 balls against India in Chennai. From there, he was parachuted into the World Cup squad, and given an opportunity as West Indies' No. 4 despite limited experience in 50-over cricket. He hit fifties against England and Afghanistan, plus a thrilling hundred against Sri Lanka, and finished the tournament with an average of 52.47 and a strike rate of 100.
 After an underwhelming first season for Kings XI Punjab in the IPL - he was previously picked up by Mumbai Indians in 2017 but did not play a game - he enjoyed a stellar 2020 season in the UAE, making 353 runs at a strike rate of 170, demonstrating his ability to dominate against spin and also pulling off a remarkable boundary save in the deep. He had come into the season off the back of a maiden T20 hundred for Guyana Amazon Warriors in the CPL, and followed it by playing his first first-class games in over six years for West Indies A in New Zealand.

Two years later, though, he was called up as cover during the ODI series against India, and thanks to a niggle to fellow injury-prone Hamish Bennett, Henry put the black cap on and registered the third-best figures for a New Zealand debutant in ODIs, claiming four wickets to seal New Zealand's 4-0 series triumph. He played in only two matches in the 2015 World Cup, and incredibly they were the most important, the semi-final against South Africa and the final against Australia.  
 Henry would make his Test debut at Lord's on the subsequent tour of England and made an immediate impression taking 4 for 93 in the first innings. Over the next four years his body held up well as he was a fairly regular member of New Zealand's Test and ODI sides and played the occasional T20I. 
 In 2019, he was a key part of New Zealand's incredible World Cup campaign. He took 14 wickets, including 4 for 47 against Bangladesh. But he saved his best spell for the winning semi-final at Old Trafford where he ripped through India's top order, claiming 3 for 37 including the tournament's leading scorer Rohit Sharma. He also took the key wicket of Jason Roy in the epic final against England at Lord's. 
 Henry stays consistently over 140kmph, likes to bowl full, and had only taken four five-fors in 14 first-class games spread over three seasons when he was called up for what initially looked like an apprenticeship with the New Zealand senior team.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1222381.html"",""Matt Henry"")"	New Zealand
MS Dhoni	Mahendra Singh Dhoni	July 7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand) 	39 years 236 days	India, Air India Blue, Asia XI, Bihar, Bradman XI, Chennai Super Kings, East Zone, East Zone Under-19s, Help for Heroes XI, India A, India Seniors, Indian Board President's XI, International XI, Jharkhand, Jharkhand Under-19s, Rajasthan Cricket Association President's XI, Rest of India, Rising Pune Supergiants, Sehwag XI	Wicketkeeper batsman	Right-hand bat	Right-arm medium	183*	Bangladesh v India at Chattogram, Dec 23, 2004	"Barring Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni is probably the most popular and definitely the most scrutinised cricketer from India. He has got to this point coming from the cricketing backwaters, the mining state of Jharkhand, and through a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scales the highs and lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India have won the top prize in all formats: topping the Test rankings for 18 months starting December 2009, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the World T20 on his captaincy debut in 2007.
 Dhoni, then a ticket inspector with the Indian Railways, had escaped all attention bar the odd whisper among the followers of club cricket in Kolkata until he was 23, when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 within a year of his debut.
 Dhoni demonstrated all that was right with the new middle-class India. He didn't respect reputations, but never disrespected either. He improvised, he learned, but didn't apologise for his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He became a multi-faceted ODI batsman, one who could accumulate, one who could rebuild, and one who could still unleash those big sixes.
 Along the way Dhoni showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up the captaincy in 2007. Just before that announcement from Dravid, Dhoni had taken a bunch of kids to South Africa and was leading India to a World Cup win in a format the country didn't even take seriously. The ODI captaincy was natural progression, and Anil Kumble just kept the seat warm in Tests for a year.
 Dhoni brought to captaincy a thick skin and relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with coach Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they returned the favour with some of their best years in international cricket. His calmness on the field helped and worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although tactically he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests. All that can't argue with the fact that India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under Dhoni.
 However, post the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and his patented helicopter shot, an ageing team kept losing in unfamiliar conditions. After eight straight Test losses away from home, Dhoni the captain came under immense pressure, which was accentuated by a 2-1 home series loss to England in 2012-13, the first time India had lost at home in more than eight years. This brought out a new chapter in Dhoni's career wherein he seemed more assertive as a captain, started building a new team, played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to four wins in a series.  
 Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came close to wins on both tours. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests, dealing with the seam movement and bounce by stepping down the pitch and taking blows on his body. Wins once again proved elusive on the tour of Australia that followed, though India competed ferociously thanks to a young batting core led by Kohli. 
 Kohli had captained the side in the first Test, with Dhoni injured, and he would lead them in the fourth Test too, with Dhoni making a surprise announcement after the third Test in Melbourne that he was retiring from the longest format. Though his game was not as suited to Tests as it was to limited-overs cricket, Dhoni ended his career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper: 4876 runs at an average of just over 38, and six hundreds. He had also captained India to more Test wins - 27 - than anyone else. 
 Dhoni continued to lead India in the shorter formats, and they shrugged off a win-less tour of Australia by reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup. A year later, they won the Asia Cup T20 in Bangladesh but exited the World T20 in the semi-finals, at home. Dhoni enjoyed a good tournament as a finisher, scoring 89 runs while only being dismissed once in five innings; he showed electric reflexes while keeping to the spinners, eventually playing on till the 2019 World Cup, though he gave up the limited-overs captaincy in January 2017.  
 India's defeat to New Zealand in the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup turned out to be Dhoni's final international match, although that wasn't officially confirmed till more than a year later. In the immediate aftermath of that result, there was lots of speculation about whether Dhoni would call it quits. He didn't, but he did opt out of India's series for the rest of 2019 and early 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic then brought all sporting action to a halt. Just as players' preparations for the delayed IPL began, in August, on India's Independence Day, Dhoni made the big announcement - on Instagram. He was retiring from all international cricket.
 In the IPL, Dhoni has been the face of the Chennai Super Kings franchise. He became so deeply associated with the city that he even became a co-owner of a Chennai-based football franchise. But in 2016, with Super Kings suspended for two seasons over issues stemming from the spot-fixing scandal of 2013, he was part of the IPL's new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants. Super Kings were reinstated in 2018 and Dhoni was back at the helm, leading the team to a fairytale third title. He almost repeated the feat in 2019, losing a thrilling final against Mumbai Indians by just 1 run.Sidharth Monga"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1220600.html"",""MS Dhoni"")"	India

By 21, de Kock shared the record for the most successive ODI centuries - three - before it was bettered by Kumar Sangakkara. A year later, he had established himself in all three formats.  
 De Kock grew up as a baseball player and even considered a move to the United States, but his father convinced him to pursue cricket instead. He attended King Edward VII High School, the alma mater of Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie, and was picked for the South African Under-19 side, which he captained briefly. The leadership mantle was taken away ahead of the 2012 World Cup in Australia in order for him to concentrate on his batting. It paid off as topped South Africa's batting charts with 284 runs from six matches at 47.33 and a best of 126.
 De Kock was contracted to the Lions in 2012-13 and caught the national selectors' eyes when he starred in a match-winning partnership with Neil McKenzie in the Champions League T20 against Mumbai Indians. He also finished fourth on the first-class rankings, despite playing only six of the 10 matches that summer. 
 He was selected for South Africa's T20I series against New Zealand in 2012-13 to keep wickets in place of AB de Villiers, who asked to be rested. But he did not make much of a first impression on the international stage. After a lean series in Sri Lanka in July 2013, he was dropped. 
 De Kock returned in November that year and scored his first ODI century against Pakistan. A month later, he reeled off three in a row against India. Early in 2014, de Kock made his Test debut after Alviro Petersen took ill, but was only given a permanent place later that year, on a tour to Sri Lanka. He scored two half-centuries in his next three Tests, but then tore ankle ligaments during warm-up in a Test against West Indies in December. 
 The injury put de Kock at risk of missing the 2015 World Cup, but he recovered quickly. However, he struggled to find his old form and struggled through that tournament and a series against Bangladesh. Subsequently, he was dropped again and sent to the South African A side to find his touch. He did well for them in India and returned to the senior side, scoring two hundred in a five-match series against India and two more against England at home to reclaim his place. 
 De Kock also hit his stride in the shortest format, and scored his maiden half-century in the 2016 World T20. Along with two contributions in the 40s, he was South Africa's most successful batsman and was named in the ICC's team of the tournament.

Over 2007 and 2008, he also emerged, still improbably young, as a hot pace prospect. Even before he went to England on an U-19 tour, he had been picked out as a special talent by Akram himself at a pace camp he oversaw in Lahore in May 2007. By 2010, he had become the hottest pace bowling prospect around the world - but within months his career was in ruins following charges of spot-fixing.  
 He began in 2009 with an impressive showing on the domestic circuit, impressing with his whippy pace and swing. He took 55 wickets for National Bank of Pakistan in his debut season, and earned selection to the Pakistan World T20 squad. There he hit the big time, taking over from an out-of-sorts Sohail Tanvir and bowling with pace, accuracy and courage. 
 He hovered in the high 80mphs, touching even 90 on occasion and was a crucial opening link in Pakistan's title run. He bowled several nerveless final overs and one absolutely crucial opening over, in the final, when he dismissed tournament top-scorer Tillakaratne Dilshan for a five-ball duck, peppering him with quick, short balls. He carried his form over to the ODI version, picking up match-winning figures of 4 for 28 against Sri Lanka in August before turning in consistent spells in the Champions Trophy. 
 He picked six wickets on Test debut in Sri Lanka. Thereafter, over tours to New Zealand, Australia and England, he matured remarkably, building up his pace and both new-ball and reverse swing. The 2010 tour of England saw the best of him and he became the youngest bowler, at 18, to take 50 Test wickets. But his world crashed around him when he was implicated in a spot-fixing scam in which it was alleged that he had bowled deliberate, pre-planned no-balls in a Test. In February 2011 he was handed a five-year ban following investigations by an ICC tribunal. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to six months in prison at Southwark Crown Court.
 After his release, Amir frequently expressed his contrition over the incident and co-operated with the ICC in spreading its anti-corruption message. Having been cleared to return to all forms of cricket in September 2015, he made his international comeback the following January, as part of Pakistan's limited-overs squad to New Zealand. On his next international assignment, the 20-over Asia Cup in Dhaka, he made waves once again, rattling India's top order with three wickets in a hostile spell of pace bowling. Amir's reintegration came full circle when he was selected in the Test squad for England later that year, setting up a comeback Test at Lord's, the venue where the spot-fixing scandal had derailed his career six years before.
 However, it is in Test cricket, the format supposedly perfectly designed for him to express his wizardry, that he has disappointed most profoundly. Magical spells with the new ball have been all too fleeting, and his performances in the three countries where conditions are arguably best suited to him, have been largely indifferent. With the ball, he averaged 42.41 in England in 2016, 28.83 in New Zealand that same year, and 61.60 when Australia whitewashed Pakistan at the turn of the year. The prodigious banana swing from that titillating left-arm angle - and that quite beautiful bowling action - does come, but not nearly as potently or regularly as memory suggests it did in his teenage years. In other words, Amir, in Test cricket, has flattered to deceive. 
 It depends on what he wants to be remembered for, though, because if he wishes to live for famous moments rather than a stellar career, he's got the biggest one tucked up already. In the Champions Trophy final against India, it was his opening salvo that put the game out of India's reach. Defending 338, he trapped Rohit Sharma in front in the first over, before taking Virat Kohli's outside edge twice in two balls - the first was dropped in the slips. Shikhar Dhawan fell at Amir's hands too, with the fast bowler's figures reading 6-2-16-3, as Pakistan stormed to victory by 180 runs.

 Rushed back into the side - there was little evidence that he had fully recovered - Roy responded with three typically domineering half-centuries (innings of 66, 60 and 85) and three century partnerships with the equally prolific Jonny Bairstow in what were effectively knock-out games against India, New Zealand and Australia. By the end of that Australia game - the World Cup semi-final - Roy had registered three centuries and six half-centuries in his previous 11 ODI innings. Ben Stokes' brilliance understandably stole the headlines in the final, but there was no way England were reaching that stage without the remarkable consistency of Roy and Bairstow. Going into the final, the pair had recorded four century stands in succession (a record for a single tournament) and 11 in 32 ODIs. And they had the highest strike-rates in history of opening batsmen with more than 1,000 ODI runs to their name.
 The swaggering strokeplay of Roy became a central feature of England's limited-overs cricket after their miserable display in the 2015 World Cup insisted that a more adventurous approach was essential. For Roy, a Surrey opener of dashing disposition, such a change of emphasis was ideal. Under the leadership of Eoin Morgan, adamant that England must play free-spirited cricket, Roy found his voice, making his maiden ODI hundred in the UAE in late 2015 before adding two more at home to Sri Lanka the following summer - including 162, at the time the second-highest ODI score made by an England batsman, in front of his adoring home crowd at The Oval.
 There was even better to come. In banishing the blues of an Ashes Test thrashing in 2017-18, Roy surpassed Alex Hales' record one-day score for England of 171 (Hales had himself gone past Robin Smith in 2016) with 180 in Melbourne as Australia recognised an England one-day side performing with a freedom of expression that surpassed anything they could muster in response. This was far removed from the batsman who had endured such a dud season in Australia's Big Bash competition.
 Born in South Africa, Roy came to the UK aged 10 and soon started to move through the system. He was a hugely successful schoolboy cricketer for Whitgift, and made his Surrey debut as a 17-year-old in 2008 during the Twenty20 Cup and his fielding talents were noticed by England, who used him as a sub later that summer against South Africa. It wasn't until 2010 that he broke into the first team again. He promptly thumped 101 off 57 balls against Kent at Beckenham, Surrey's first T20 hundred. Later in the summer he struck an unbeaten 76 from 65 balls against Leicestershire on Championship debut. England's selectors gave him a place on the Performance Programme tour to India before the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka in early 2012.
 Roy's obvious ability in the shorter formats led to him twice winning T20 contracts in the Bangladesh Premier League but he struggled to build on a quietly impressive role in Surrey's 2011 promotion campaign, when he made his maiden first-class hundred. In 2013, he made two YB40 centuries - doubling his List A tally - but struggled badly in Championship cricket, scoring just 49 runs in seven innings.
 It was in 2014 that Roy made the leap from a prodigiously talented but erratic young cricketer to a consistent match-winner. The transformation was particularly evident in the NatWest T20 Blast, where he struck 677 runs at 48.35 apiece - the highest tally in the competition. England's T20 competition had undeniably produced an exciting batsman of international quality. Roy's uncomplicated clean-striking became as much a feature of Friday nights at The Oval as the beer-snakes and streakers. With his breathtaking power down the ground and penchant for switch-hitting - not to mention the fact he was born in South Africa - he was frequently compared to Kevin Pietersen, not least by Pietersen himself. His brilliance did not achieve the same levels in the following two summers - how could it? - but a destructive hundred against Somerset in 2015, and against Kent the following year, was a reminder of his unfettered talent.
 After working hard on pacing his innings in four-day cricket, Roy also blossomed in Championship cricket in 2014, hitting 1078 runs, the highest at the club, at an average of 50-plus without reigning in his destructiveness: his strike rate was still 84. He also averaged 47.65 in the Championship in a promotion year in 2015, his strike rate even higher.  
 By the summer's end, he was rewarded with a T20 international debut against India and in 2015 he became a fixture in England's limited-overs formats, building on a couple of promising 60s against Australia with a maiden ODI ton against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, an innings that was rarely fluent - and that was entirely overshadowed by Jos Buttler's dash to his own hundred in record time - but one that provided proof of a growing survival mentality.
 After a breakthrough year in international cricket, which included helping England to the World T20 final, he won a maiden IPL contract for the 2017 tournament. But spending most of his time sitting in the dugout for Gujarat Lions was not productive and his form faltered ahead of the 2017 Champions Trophy. He had failed to pass 20 in nine ODI innings and was eventually dropped from England's side for the semi-final (which they lost), but he rebounded well in the late-September ODIs against West Indies after Hales' night out in Bristol cost him his spot. 
 The crowd-pleasing innings soon began to occur with increasing regularity, as one half of a prolific opening partnership with Jonny Bairstow that embodied the devil-may-care approach of an exciting England side that found itself top of the ODI rankings. As well as the Melbourne 180 (which also included a record-breaking 221 stand for the third wicket with Joe Root), there were further hundreds against Australia in Cardiff and Chester-le-Street in 2018; followed by two more, against West Indies and Pakistan, in the lead-up to the World Cup, pushing his average above 40 and leading to increased calls for him to be considered for the Ashes to follow later in 2019.
 He was unable to replicate such dominance when that Test call came. Despite an innings of 72 made from No. 3 on debut (England had utilised a nightwatchman) against Ireland, the somewhat puzzling decision to use him as an opening batsman - a role he had long since abandoned for Surrey; indeed, he had never batted for two complete sessions in a first-class game - exposed issues against the moving ball. In four Ashes Tests, he averaged just 13.75 with a best of 31. By the time he was demoted to No. 4, his confidence looked to have been eroded and he was dropped ahead of the final Test at The Oval.

 Although primarily a fast bowler, Coulter-Nile first earned a call-up to Australia's Champions Trophy squad in 2013 through his all-round talents as much as his work with the ball. Described by the national selector John Inverarity as ""one of the three or four best fieldsmen in Australia"", Coulter-Nile is an energetic presence on the field and adds explosive lower-order hitting to any side for which he plays. However, his international career has been stop-start since day one with serious back, hamstring and shoulder injuries repeatedly curtailing any attempt at an extended run in the international side. He fought back from a shoulder dislocation in late 2015 to play in the 2016 T20 World Cup and came back from two back injuries to make the 2019 World Cup squad. 
 He has been on the cusp of the Test side on a number of occasions but injury and Australia's strong fast bowling depth have prevented him from earning a baggy green and a back injury in 2017 meant he had to opt out of first-class cricket for the time being to aid his longevity in the limited overs formats. 
 An awkward bowler to face, Coulter-Nile can get the ball to kick off a good length at speed. He announced himself in the 2012-13 Australian domestic season when won the Laurie Sawle Medal as Western Australia's Player of the Year. It was a breakthrough season for Coulter-Nile, who made his T20I debut in February and was sold to Mumbai Indians for $450,000 at the IPL auction the same month and has since been bought by four different franchises. He was a promising volleyball player in his youth but his raw cricketing talent saw him become an Australia Under-19s representative before making his debut for Western Australia in late 2009.ESPNcricinfo"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1186410.html"",""Nathan Coulter-Nile"")"	Australia

An opener by reputation, Thirimanne made his debut in early 2010 and earnt sporadic places in the national side over the next two years, but it was not until he was moved to the middle order in 2012 that he unearthed the consistency that would make him a regular at the top level.  
 A measured batsman, if at times a limited one, Thirimanne has been a contrasting ally for Sri Lanka's middle-order dashers in ODI cricket, striking particularly memorable partnerships with Angelo Mathews to lift Sri Lanka out of trouble.
 His forte has always been the longest form however, as evidenced by a first-class average of almost 60 in his first full season for Ragama CC. Thirimanne could not recreate that form in his first few Tests as an opener, but conjured his finest innings to date at no. 4, when he stepped off a plane 36 hours before the 2013 New Year Test to strike a sparkling 91 on the first day in Sydney. Ten days later he hit a maiden international hundred in an ODI to take Sri Lanka to victory in Adelaide.

 Warner was charged as the man who instructed team-mate Cameron Bancroft to use sandpaper on the ball in the infamous Cape Town Test. Although he was not charged by the ICC he was banned from international and Australian domestic cricket by Cricket Australia for 12 months. He was stripped of the vice-captaincy and banned from leadership roles for life.
 However, he returned for the 2019 World Cup and enjoyed a prolific tournament before suffering a record-breakingly poor Ashes were he made just 95 runs in 10 innings. The bounce back was emphatic as he scored an unbeaten 335 against Pakistan in Adelaide - the second highest Test score by an Australian - during a home summer which was crowned with the Allan Border Medal
 Prior to his ban, Warner had established himself as one of the best all-format openers in the world. In 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides and he led the ODI side and T20 sides with great success when Smith was rested. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching England's Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had also been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It also completed a remarkable rise for a man who burst onto the international scene in 2008-09 as a T20 specialist; he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well.
 His debut in the baggy green came, appropriately, in Test match No. 2020, against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2011, and in his second match he achieved what Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden never did - he carried his bat through a Test innings. His unbeaten 123 in Hobart could not prevent a historic New Zealand win, but his patience in challenging conditions showed a different side to his batsmanship. Later in the same summer he made a very different kind of hundred, a 69-ball ton against India at the WACA. From his debut in late 2011, he was far and away the best performed Test opener in the world over the seven-year span prior to his ban.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1099532.html?alt=1"",""David Warner"")"	Australia
Hashim Amla	Hashim Mahomed Amla	March 31, 1983, Durban, Natal 	37 years 334 days	South Africa, Barbados Tridents, Cape Cobras, Derbyshire, Dolphins, Essex, Khulna Tigers, Kings XI Punjab, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa XI, Trinbago Knight Riders, World-XI	Top-order batsman	Right-hand bat	Right-arm medium, Right-arm offbreak	159	Bangladesh v South Africa at Chattogram, Mar 9, 2008	"The classiest, calmest man on a cricket field, Hashim Amla's name is etched in South African cricket history. With his wristy leg-side flick and serene cover drive, Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket, while also effectively shifting gears to become the fastest batsman to 2,000 (40 innings), 3,000 (57 innings), 4,000 (81 innings) and 5,000 (101 innings) runs in ODI cricket.  
 Amla's career began at Durban High School, the alma mater of Lance Klusener and Barry Richards, and a world away from his brother, Ahmed. Just four years apart, they grew up on either side of the Apartheid divide, which meant that Ahmed went to a school for the previously disadvantaged, while Amla was afforded better opportunity at a more prestigious institution. 
 After a successful school career, Amla toured New Zealand with the South African Under-19 team in 2000-01 and captained them at the 2002 Under-19 World Cup. After reeling off four centuries in his first eight innings of the 2004-05 season - in which he was also appointed, and stepped down as, Dolphins captain - he was picked to play for South Africa against India.  
 He was not an instant success, with serious questions emerging about his technique and his back lift, in particular, as he mustered 36 runs in four innings against England later that season.
 When he was handed a second chance, he made it count with 149 against New Zealand at Cape Town, helping South Africa to a draw. He remained a consistent performer, even if not as prolific as South Africa would have liked, and made fifties against Pakistan in 2007. But he saved his best for the following year's tour of India, where he racked up 307 runs in three Tests. That included a majestic 159 in Chennai, his second score of 150 or more. He followed that with a pugnacious 81 in the second innings, in conditions that were trying, thanks to the weather, the pitch and the attack. In the summer of 2008, he got his name on the honours board at Lord's with a sublime century, and, in the process, silenced all whimpers about his pedigree for the longest version.
 Still, doubts remained over his ability in the shorter formats, but Amla corrected that in 2010. He scored over 1,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket.  It started with a magnum opus tour of India, where the hosts threw everything at him, but could not find a way past his monk-like patience and ability to soak pressure. In the two-Test series, he scored 490 runs and was dismissed just once. In ODIs, he combined quick scoring with stunning consistency, scoring five centuries and four fifties in 15 innings, all the while scoring at over a run a ball, which saw him rise to No.1 in the ODI rankings that year.
 He was promoted to South Africa's leadership core when he was named vice-captain of the ODI and T20 international teams in June 2011, and later that year, scored centuries in both Tests South Africa played against Australia at home. But Amla's crowning moment came the following year, when he got South Africa's quest to become the No.1-ranked Test team off to an epic start, spending 13 hours and 10 minutes at the Oval crease crafting a triple hundred, and not even needing a change of gloves. Amla also scored a century at Lord's as South Africa took the Test mace from the hosts. 
 A quickfire 196 against Australia in Perth ensured South Africa stayed on top, and in February 2013, Amla was the ICC's top-ranked Test batsman. He had also decided to keep away from captaincy promotions, and stepped down as the limited-overs vice-captain. 
 That was why it came as a surprise when, less than 18 months later, Amla accepted the Test captaincy. His tenure was off to a solid start as South Africa beat Sri Lanka 1-0 away from home in his first series in charge, and West Indies at home in his second, in which Amla scored a double hundred in the first match. But that proved a false dawn.
 Amla had taken over a team in transition and South Africa's struggles came in 2015. They lost a four-Test series in India 3-0 and returned home to lose the opening Test against England. Amla's own form also suffered and he had not crossed fifty in a year. The New Year's Test of 2016 brought a change of fortune as he scored a double hundred, having decided to give up captaincy. He announced that he was stepping down after the Test was drawn.Firdose Moonda"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1100134.html?alt=1"",""Hashim Amla"")"	South Africa

When he eventually did take the game up, however, he progressed quickly through Afghanistan's age group sides as a batting allrounder and was the youngest member of the team that won the Division Five tournament in 2008 - the first stepping stone to the full world stage. 
 But Gulbadin was dropped after that tournament, and had to deal with several pressing hardships in his personal life. His father was unemployed, his mother had contracted hepatitis, and the family was struggling to deal with the needs of his disabled sister. Happily, he was able to force his way back into the national team in 2011, and his full-time central contract helped to bring a little more stability to his home. Since then, he's settled into a floating role in Afghanistan's middle order, chipping in with both bat and ball, and his game has progressed most rapidly in cricket's shortest format. Gulbadin hits almost as many sixes as fours in Twenty20 cricket, and he's expressed an interest in opening the batting for Afghanistan in T20s in the not-too-distant future.Liam Brickhill"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1221777.html"",""Gulbadin Naib"")"	Afghanistan

It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances.  
 Karthik was still a giant in domestic cricket though, and had a knack for turning up on turning tracks. No doubt his penchant to sweep, reverse sweep and hare down that track at spinners helped his cause. Those quick feet have at times failed him behind the stumps - often at crucial junctures. He was recalled to the Indian side for a tour of Bangladesh in 2014 - but his wicketkeeping let him down.
 Karthik made over 1000 first-class runs in the 2008-09 season, with five centuries including a 213 as Tamil Nadu captain as they reached the semi-finals. For five seasons since - barring 2010-11, 2013 [when he played only one match] and 2015-16 - he had maintained a batting average above 40. Karthik found himself in contention again after Dhoni's retirement in 2014, but Wriddhiman Saha was preferred because he was seen as the stronger keeper.
  An in-and-out history with the Indian team didn't help. He was picked in the one-day squad, as replacement for Parthiv Patel in August 2004, and made his debut in a NatWest Challenge game against England where he pulled off a superb stumping. Shortly afterwards, he was called up to make his Test debut against Australia but when he could manage only one fifty in ten matches, he was axed.
  He made a comeback in 2008 - picked in the Indian side for all three formats for a tour of New Zealand - but his middling performances continued over the following year and did not allow him to cement a place in the team. He fell out of contention, until a fine 2012-13 domestic season got him back into the ODI side for the 2013 Champions Trophy in England but it proved to be another false dawn.
  Karthik may feel unfulfilled when he looks back on his international career, but the IPL should have helped soothe him. He was bought at INR 12.5 crore by Delhi Daredevils in the 2014 auction and the next year, he netted INR 10.5 crore courtesy Royal Challengers Bangalore. He was acquired by Gujarat Lions for INR 2.3 crore in 2016.ESPNcricinfo staff"	"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.espncricinfo.com/inline/content/image/1223360.html"",""Dinesh Karthik"")"	India

But, after building a reputation as an elegant batsman, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann. 
 While many critics dismissed him as a ""part-time"" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. He had also developed a doosra after working with his friend and sometimes Worcestershire teammate, Saeed Ajmal.
 But it was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. He made an outstanding, unbeaten century in his second Test, at Headingley, as England went within two balls of saving the series and while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an England spinner in a Test, he struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling in his first three appearances.
 That changed in training for the Lord's Test against India. Encouraged by team-mate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test offspinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an on-looker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight.
 It was to prove a pivotal meeting. Moeen was tighter at Lord's, devastating in Southampton and excellent at Old Trafford as he finished the series with 19 wickets; the fourth highest haul any spinner had claimed against India in a Test series outside the subcontinent and the best since 1967 when Ray Illingworth bowled 30 more overs and claimed one more victim.
 While he struggled to recapture his batting form in Test cricket, he took his chance when promoted to the top of the order in the ODI side by hitting a 72-ball century in Colombo and ended the year a regular in all formats.
 He had looked destined for such success for some time. Signed by Warwickshire as a 15-year-old, he made a century on first-class debut against Cambridge MCCU (he remains the second-youngest man to score a first-class half-century for the club) and Championship debut against Nottinghamshire but was dropped for the next game on both occasions. He also captained England U-19s to the semi-final of the 2006 World Cup, blasted a 56-ball century in an U-19 Test against Sri Lanka and, as a 14-year-old, smashed 195 not out in a Twenty20 match for his under-15 club side Moseley Ashfield. The next highest score was 11.
 But, frustrated by a lack of opportunity at Warwickshire during Mark Greatbatch's ill-fated reign as coach of the club, he left for local rivals Worcestershire at the end of 2006 and was a key part of the team that won the Pro-40 title in 2007. It included a 46-ball century against Northants in 2007; there had, at the time, been only one faster List A century made in England in matches involving two first-class counties.
 There were setbacks. Trying to combat a tendency to nick off, he went through a period of batting like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and then a spell of leaving balls that hit his off stump instead. But he made 1270 runs at 47.03 in 2010 and 1375 runs at 62.50 in 2013 - the year he won the PCA's most valuable player award - as he augmented his flair with increased discipline outside off stump. And, all the time, he was working on his offspin, claiming 33 wickets at 29.00 in 2012 and 28 at 33.71 a later year.
 It was enough to earn him an England call-up for the ODI series in the West Indies at the start of 2014 and the World T20 in Bangladesh a few weeks later.
 His older brother, Kadeer, played for Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Leicestershire while their cousin, Kabir was once a team-mate of Moeen's at Worcestershire, and was the first of the family to play international cricket. 
 Moeen's development had a significance beyond the playing field. Taking on the mantle of role-model for fellow British Asians - a sector of society that county cricket has not always encouraged as it might have done - he also talked eloquently of his Muslim faith and grew perhaps the most noticeable beard in English cricket since the days of WG Grace.

They closely monitored his progress to Richmond College and then to the Tamil Union team whom he represents in domestic cricket. What impressed the coaches about Lakmal was his height and ability to get bounce and swing at a tender age. Despite his natural ability, Lakmal had one big deficiency in that he lacked the stamina to bowl long spells and on occasions he did, he regularly fell ill. The lack of nutrition was quite common with fast bowlers coming from outside Colombo and soon after Lakmal was inducted into the academy, the coaches worked on developing his stamina. Good performances with Sri Lanka A saw him break into the national ODI side. He was one of three players marked for the future by Chandika Hathurusingha in 2008 when he coached the A side.

Steven Smith	Steven Peter Devereux Smith	June 2, 1989, Sydney, New South Wales 	31 years 271 days	Australia, Antigua Hawksbills, Australia A, Australian Institute of Sports, Australian XI, Barbados Tridents, Comilla Victorians, Delhi Capitals, Graeme Hick XII, Kent 2nd XI, Kochi Tuskers Kerala, New South Wales, New South Wales Second XI, New South Wales Under-19s, Pune Warriors, Rajasthan Royals, Rising Pune Supergiants, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Surrey 2nd XI, Sutherland, Sydney Sixers, Sydney South East, Toronto Nationals, Worcestershire	Middle-order batsman	Right-hand bat	Legbreak googly	164	Australia v West Indies at Melbourne, Feb 19, 2010	"It has been career of incredible twists and turns. Steven Smith was a legspinner who has become Australia's best batsman since Sir Donald Bradman either side of having his career derailed by the Newlands ball-tampering scandal which saw him stripped of the captaincy and banned for 12 months. 
 The rise from the controversy was as notable as the fall as he returned to Test cricket with a 774-run Ashes series in 2019, the pictures of him in tears at Sydney airport replaced with triumphant celebrations of centuries. Part of his punishment for Cape Town was been banned from any leadership position for two years, but he became eligible to be Australia captain in March 2020 should that turn of events come about.
 He began his Test career as a legspinner who batted at No.8; by the time he was named Australia's captain five years later, he was the No.1 Test batsman in the world and no more than an occasional bowler. Smith's talent was apparent early, but as a young batsman he had more moving parts than an orchestra, only they didn't always work in harmony. He went away and worked on his game and returned to the Test side two years later with a much tighter technique. He still fidgeted between balls (by 2019 perhaps more so then ever) but could play every shot in the book, and a few more that defied words besides. Smith is quick-footed and adept at facing spin, but is equally comfortable driving and pulling the fast bowlers.
 It in the 2014-15 home summer that he became Australia's 45th Test captain, filling in for the injured Michael Clarke in three Tests. Despite being only 25 at the time the extra responsibility clearly didn't hamper his run-making. It became clear that Smith was to be Clarke's successor, a move that was confirmed after Clarke's retirement at the end of the 2015 Ashes in England.
 As Smith's batting developed his bowling became less frequently sighted, although he could still land the odd fizzing leg-break and winkle out a wicket or two. In the field Smith's athleticism and instinct stands out, even in a high-quality fielding side like Australia. He has also become a key man in Australia's ODI side, and was his country's leading run scorer in their triumphant 2015 World Cup campaign and he became captain in all three formats before his career was turned upside down.

Tamim Iqbal	Tamim Iqbal Khan	March 20, 1989, Chittagong 	31 years 345 days	Bangladesh, Asia XI, Bangladesh A, Bangladesh Under-19s, Chittagong Division, Dhaka Platoon, Duronto Rajshahi, Fortune Barishal, ICC World XI, Lahore Qalandars, Nottinghamshire, Peshawar Zalmi, Pune Warriors, St Lucia Zouks, Wellington, World-XI	Opening batsman	Left-hand bat		158	Zimbabwe v Bangladesh at Harare, Feb 9, 2007	"Tamim Iqbal was already one of Bangladesh's most assured batsmen at the time of his 21st birthday, and will be a vital component at the top of the order for years to come. His promise was apparent when, batting for the Under-19s against England at the end of 2005, he smashed 112 from just 71 balls to help Bangladesh cruise to victory. The left-hander is regarded as one of the most exciting prospects in Bangladesh cricket and is arguably the hardest hitter of the cricket ball in the country. His elegance and style through the off side is a treat to watch but his trademark shot is the straight drive, capped with a text-book like follow-through.  
 Tamim is the younger brother of Bangladesh international Nafis Iqbal Khan and nephew of former Bangladesh skipper Akram Khan. He made his one-day debut against Zimbabwe in February 2007 and was included in the World Cup squad after playing just two matches. His straight six off Zaheer Khan after skipping down the track was one of the best shots of the tournament. He scored a stylish 84 in his debut Test, against New Zealand in Dunedin and has since firmly established his spot at the top of the order. His maiden century came in 2009 against West Indies in St Vincent, a match-winning effort. He then set a national record against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo when he blasted an unbeaten 154 in a tall chase.
 Tamim has found England's bowling attack particularly to his liking, and a superb run of form against them in two series, home and away, lead to five scores of more than fifty in six Test innings, culminating in his stunning 103 at Lord's in May 2010.

Shakib Al Hasan	Shakib Al Hasan	March 24, 1987, Magura, Jessore 	33 years 341 days	Bangladesh, Adelaide Strikers, Bangladesh A, Bangladesh Cricket Board XI, Barbados Tridents, Brampton Wolves, Dhaka Gladiators, Gemcon Khulna, Jamaica Tallawahs, Karachi Kings, Khulna Division, Kolkata Knight Riders, Peshawar Zalmi, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Worcestershire	Allrounder	Left-hand bat	Slow left-arm orthodox	134*	Zimbabwe v Bangladesh at Harare, Aug 6, 2006	"When the annals of Bangladesh cricket are sifted by future generations, Shakib Al Hasan will emerge and re-emerge as the greatest cricketer of its first two decades. His on-field performances and off-field professionalism set a benchmark that was followed by peers and juniors alike. As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams. 
 The best of his ability and temperament were on display in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, when Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. In only his fourth Test as captain, Shakib scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton, performances that offered further proof of his skill and ability to handle pressure. Against the same opponents in 2008, Shakib took 7 for 36 in Chittagong, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking seven or more wickets in a Test innings.
 In ODIs, Shakib's contributions have been equally vital with bat and ball and he became the first from Bangladesh to achieve the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. He also became the first batsman from Bangladesh to score five hundreds, despite mostly batting at No. 5.
 Being clearly the best player in the team, it wasn't surprising when Shakib was handed the captaincy in 2009 after Mashrafe Mortaza repeatedly got injured during his first tenure. His ability to perform consistently and to stay calm under pressure worked well for Bangladesh, as they won 22 out of 47 games under him, and even beat England in the 2011 World Cup. However, the World Cup campaign was followed by a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a one-off Test and the ODI series, which led to Shakib's removal as captain.
 His form hardly waned, however, as he quickly bounced back to help Bangladesh bowl out West Indies for 61 in an ODI; a hundred and five-for in the same Test - something he has done twice - followed later in the year. He remained consistent for Bangladesh and his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders, but in 2014 Shakib lapsed into off-field shenanigans that saw him fined for lewdly gesticulating at the camera from the dressing-room during an ODI against Sri Lanka, then suspended for six months by the BCB for misbehaving with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and threatening to quit Bangladesh duty. The ban was lifted early and Shakib made the vice-captain in the ODI and T20 formats under Mashrafe. His match-winning ability was undimmed and he played key roles in Bangladesh wins during their stellar 2015.
